				When I discovered that I could use IBM's Watson to calculate emotion and sentiment from text using an API, I started building this. My original intent was to see what Watson would think of the general sentiment of different cities, with the idea of using reddit subreddits as the source text. 
				</p>
				<p>Built with node and MongoDB, with front-end component using HTML/CSS/Angular. Using Reddit's API with the IBM Watsonâ„¢ AlchemyLanguage service for data.</p>

				The result of playing around with the paper.js and howler.js libraries. Use keyboard (select letters and space bar) to interact. The way the notes are mapped to the keyboard loosely resemble how the notes are oriented around a hang drum, and where you would strike the drum to produce the note.</p>

				<p> This was a quick project after listening to a friend play the hang drum for the first time. It made me curious what it was about the hang drum that produced such calming sounds. A digital representation does not hold a modicum of light to the powerful serenity of the actual instrument, but I wanted to see what would happen if the similar sounds were used.
