**Err on the side of action.**

---

There is no one right way to build a product, nor is there a one-size-fits-all type of strategy.

One approach of doing things at one organization may not work at all at a different organization; there are too many variables that are in flux.

With that being said though, if you find yourself in a position where you DON'T know what to do, you can still have OPINIONS on what might work. Recognizing when and how to apply certain product methods is the value that experience brings. Being able to ARTICULATE this recognition and INFLUENCE the team in a direction will set PMs apart.

That being said, if you find yourself facing decision paralysis with all these things that COULD happen... keep it simple. Your job is to simplify things to make it easier for others to consume.
