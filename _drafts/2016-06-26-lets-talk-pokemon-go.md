Pokemon Go is insanely popular right now.

[TechCrunch recently posted](https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/13/pokemon-go-tops-twitters-daily-users-sees-more-engagement-than-facebook/) that Pokemon Go has topped Twitter's Daily Users, and sees more engagement on Facebook, according to reports from various tracking firms.

That is pretty ridiculous.

Within a few mere days, it's become the biggest US mobile game EVER, with its usage numbers closing in on Snapchat on Android, and *even Google Maps* on Android.  It's getting people to explore, exercise, and even (gasp) socialize. And [it's been causing some pretty bizarre things to happen](http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/pokemon-go-the-eight-weirdest-incidents-so-far-w212891) too. 

How long can this usage keep up?  Does this game have lasting power?  

As much as I want it to last forever, I'm fairly certain it won't maintain this level of popularity, as all things that go viral eventually fall back to acceptable numbers. 

However, I want to take the opportunity to break down a few aspects of the game that drove its virality, and maybe a few things that will help maintain some sort of popularity. 

I'll assume that you somewhat know how this game works already, so I won't go into too much to explaining the mechanics.

Nostalgia + Hype
================
Let's be honest here. This was a game 20 years in the making. Every PokeTrainer, retired and current, has been waiting for this game to come out ever since they caught their first Pokemon in their GameBoy, or watched Ash Ketchum triumph against all odds through the power of love and friendship.

</span>The amount of hype that had been generated for this game was pretty crazy. As far as I remember, there were maybe... [one video commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sj2iQyBTQs) for it that spread like wildfire before, and that was enough. Notice that the commercial wasn't directed towards kids. It was clearly directed towards the generation that grew up with the game. 

The casual fans had the game on their radars, and the serious ones would be counting down the days until release. Also, people gave Nintendo a lot of flak for the odd [Pokemon Super Bowl ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F46tGehnfo) that didn't seem to really advertise anything. For those that don't remember, the advert showed sequences of people being inspired to train for something, and near the end a person walking into a Pokemon stadium, and as the Pokemon battle starts, they show it inspiring a kid and his father (and Pikachu!) watching the battle on TV.  The tagline being "TRAIN ON: Celebrating 20 years of Pokemon".  

Given the success of Pokemon Go, I'm positive it did exactly what it needed to. By showing the kid and his father both entranced, it immediately reminded 20 and 30-somethings of their youth and how magical Pokemon was at the time. It quickly planted the seed of "How cool would it be if Pokemon were in our world?" Around that time, I'm sure the last thing people were doing was reminiscing about Pokemon.  

So imagine some months later Pokemon Go is released.  "So you're saying I can walk around and just FIND Pokemon in the real world? AND I can catch them??" 

Instantly sold. 

Technical Difficulties
======================

And when the game finally launched... Server issues galore. <span class="image right">
<img src="http://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Pokemon-Go-Server-Issues-635x384.jpg">
</span>Gym battle glitches, Pokemon capture glitches, map update glitches, check-in glitches.

For ANY other game, this would've caused players to jump ship immediately. The frustration wouldn't be worth the effort to play. But not so for Pokemon. 

This was a game everyone wanted, and during a time when everyone was looking for a reason to escape, they found it in Pokemon Go. The players right now will slog through the server issues, the battery drains, just so they can continue to catch them all.

Low Barrier of Entry
====================
So the game itself has a level of hype that is typically unmatched for mobile games. And the game is... free. It costs zero dollars for players to relive a childhood dream of theirs. That's worth it. 

This game was primed for a viral start, just by sheer numbers. 

Engagement
==========
The game is incredibly simple, as mobile games tend to be. The must-know mechanics are easy to grasp; the player opens the app, and walks around in the real-world, looking at the screen. Walk towards the beacons to check in, and if a Pokemon appears, try and catch it.

The key advantage that Pokemon Go has over other recently popular games is a basic sense of level and achievement, and, most importantly a pure sense of unadulterated exploration. And how Pokemon Go achieves that is brilliant. 

As it is right now, a lot of the game relies on slot machine mechanics. Pokemon spawn randomly, in random places, at random times. They spawn just often enough so that players never get too frustrated by the hunt, and they spawn infrequently enough that the players always feel rewarded for their efforts. And even though the Pokemon spawning location and timing is random, the game brilliantly makes the players work for it. If players choose to, they can check to see which Pokemon are nearby, and physically play hot-cold with it until they catch it. Players of any game like to feel rewarded for their efforts, and even though players KNOW that a lot of the game is up to the random number generator, it is that POSSIBILITY that the rare Pokemon appears that will keep players engaged. THIS is challenge that players feel they are being rewarded for. 

There are plenty of similar reward systems in video games these days, ones where gameplay is rewarded with random drops that help scratch the "completionist" itch that many of us have.  Pokemon Go has a similar system, but with one hugely obvious, <span class="image right">

and incredibly important difference: everything in the game requires physical exploration. Players are required to go outside and walk, bike, *move physical location* to progress in the game.  And this, I feel, changes the psychology of the game altogether. 

Mobile games have long relied on short, addicting, bite-sized sessions that can be played in any moment. If a person wants to take a break, a quick level of Angry Birds wouldn't hurt anyone. In fact, for many progression-based leveling based mobile game, game sessions are often severely limited, employing a "hearts" or "lives" or "energy" system.  A single Pokemon Go session, however, can go... for as long as the player is willing to play.  If the player only has time to run to the corner store and back, the player can fire up the app and walk. If the player has a whole afternoon to explore a city, that whole afternoon can be dedicated to Pokemon Go. 

And the player is ENGAGED like never before. If the player wants to find Pokemon, the app MUST be active. The game forces the player to PLAY the game actively.  If the player isn't paying attention, the player could miss valuable items, or even worse, a super rare Pokemon. 

This is changing the playing field for mobile games.  Elements of popular MMORPGs rarely translate well to mobile games due to the limits of the world contained in the screen. The entire world of Candy Crush is located in that tiny device in your hand. If you look up, that world is gone. If you turn off the screen, the world shuts down. 

But for Pokemon Go, the real world IS part of the fantasy world. Turning off your phone merely shuts down the portal between the two worlds, but both worlds will continue to exist. This is Augmented Reality (AR), and Pokemon Go is just scratching the surface. 

Seeing another person catch a Pokmeon INSTANTLY elicits emotions of jealousy and FOMO that no other mobile game can generate, because the world of Pokemon is always spinning. And *all you have to do is pull out your phone* to keep playing.  Cries of "THERE'S A SQUIRTLE HERE" become signal beacons to anyone NOT playing at the moment to get sucked back in again. It's an event that happens in a specific time, in a specific place, in a fantasy world that... is actually our world.
