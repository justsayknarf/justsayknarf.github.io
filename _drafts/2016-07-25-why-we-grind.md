What is it about games and grinding?  Why do we do it? Why do we like to do it? DO we even LIKE doing it? What makes one grind in a game, when, in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't matter? 

It's a common aspect of games now, with the rise of mobile games, and it's something that really should be understood when designing a game or teaching a new skill. 

What is a grind?
=======

The grind is most commonly correlated with the idea of character progression. A mundane repetetive task to be executed over and over in order to gain something in return.  In RPGs, it often involves killing the same enemies over and over in a same location in order to gain experience, progressing the character, and not the story. It might be repeatedly mashing A on the gamepad, or repeatedly clicking, staring at the screen, watching the XP bar gradually increase, until the bar fills up completely, and an arbitrary number increases by 1, telling the player it was all worth it.

And then you do it all again. 

It's such a staple (and almost required) in games nowadays, that designers are allowed to include the grind because it is understood to be a necessary part of a game.  However, if done poorly, the grind is nothing but lazy.  It's a poor means for a game designer to unnaturally extend the length of his/her game, and the game's overall quality suffers for it. 

But if obviously doesn't have to be this way. 

So let's take a look at why people are willing to do this "meaningless" task in the first place, and how they can be done well, and how some games fail. 

Why?
====

To understand why people grind in the first place, it might be worth understanding why people enjoy playing games at all. 

Games are inherently an escape, a form of entertainment.  I mean this with no negative connotation.  Video games are a way for a player to experience a new world with a new set of rules, a challenge for players to solve in a format that books and movies cannot provide. The player is invested in that way, as it elicits the feeling that the player's choices will affect the outcome. The feeling of finishing a game is akin to completing a puzzle, finishing a book, finishing a movie, with different levels of immersion, interaction, and involvement.

No matter what you're going through, no matter how hard your life is, playing a game a little more guarantees forward progress, in the form of knowledge, story, or mastery.  That's as psychologically satisfying as it gets.

It's not pointless repetition.  It's a clear and identifiable PERCEIVED PROGRESS toward a goal that compells a player to grind.  

If the grind itself isn't fun, the next short term reward should be enough to balance out repetition. To understand how they should work together, it's worth looking at them separately.

Short Term Rewards
======
Games relying completely on short term rewards exploit a person's vulnerability towards addiction. (see Skinner Box related discussions)

At its most extreme case and morally questionable, look at slot machines. 

The player repeats a mundane task over and over, bombarded with lights and sounds and spinning visual cues, and the CHANCE to reap reward.  And when you do win, golly does it feel good. 

There is no long term narrative that keeps the player going back to the same slot machine.  The only narrative is: "Just one more pull. Maybe the next one will be the one where I double my money." The action potential for one more is low.  The investment is low.  The chance for reward, in the mind of the player, is high, because the anticipation alone is a positive experience.


Long Term Rewards
======
Things that rely heavily on the long term reward test a person's grit, or the ability to persist through hardships towards a bigger payoff in the end. 

An example that requires little stretch of the imagination is training for a marathon. The mundane task of running... for 26.2 miles, just to be able to say: "I've run a marathon." 

Training for a marathon requires drive, grit, determination. The goal itself needs to mark all the checkboxes in order to push you to action. Think of all the people you know that go on 26 mile runs just for fun.  Think of all the people that announce they need to start training because they just signed up for a marathon. 

The action potential to train for a marathon is high. It often requires a monetary deposit ("Well, I paid this much money to register, I have to do this now."), with added social pressures, regimented training schedules, etc. on TOP of long-term bucket list accomplishment: run a marathon.  

The run is a grind. 

Why is this important in games? When SHOULD games have grinds?
=====

If you want to ensure the player has a certain level of mastery, introducing a soft barrier before allowing the player to proceed forces the player to stop and grind before proceeding. This could be in the form of an actual level requirement (you must be at least Level 10 to enter this room), item requirement (you must collect 10 more gems), or required enemy encounters (super strong enemies). 

For multiplayer games, it helps ensure a level playing field. People with certain levels have understandably put in a specific amount of time to get to that level, which can somewhat guarantee a certain degree in skill and mechanics of the game.

Arguably all games have grinds. It's a matter of presentation and having enough game content where the grind is not used as an artificial filler to extend gameplay. 

SHOULD games have grinds?
======

Games don't NEED grinds. Grinds should be introduced for a REASON. 

For the grind to be enjoyable, designers must understand what type of game they are designing, who the players are, and how short-term goals and long-term goals should be identified and defined accordingly. 

Understanding when a grind should and should not be used is key.

Sim-type games may not require any "grind" as the game's core is mastery of the simulation at hand. The gameplay itself is a "grind" in a sense, and it is the process of learning and exploration that is enjoyed. See: Kerbal Space Program, Sim City.  

Narrative and interactive story-telling games do not have "grinds" because these games are simple mediums for the game designers to immerse the player in a new world to tell a story. See: Telltale-style games, Life is Strange, Heavy Rain.

Again, grinds are NOT replacements for game content. 

Grinds should be treated as OPPORTUNITIES to hone behaviors and masteries. 

Repeatedly mashing one button over and over for every enemy encounter is boring. Being presented 5 different types of enemies at once, and requiring a slightly different button combination or skillset to defeat each one in one battle is not. Over time, whether the player knows it or not, visual and audio cues will drill the gameplay into the player's mind, and eventually the player will have the muscle memory and the mastery to go along with it.

Back to Pokemon Go... again
====

Pokemon Go is unfortunately the reason that prompted me to do some thinking and research and write this post. The people of Niantic adopted the gameplay of Ingress and tried to slap a new Pokemon theme on top of it, and it shows. The design from a full game experience is incredibly lacking.

The biggest complaint I had with gameplay was the lack of a REASON or ANY hint of narrative to encourage the gameplay. 

The ENTIRE game is a grind, and it's obvious as soon as the player understands the mechanics of the game. 

The main motivating long term goal is to catch all the Pokemon. However, it's widely known that this is literally impossible to do, given that several are region-locked, and other have simply not been released.  Nowhere in the game is this long-term goal even encouraged beyond the "# caught / 150 " display in one part of the game. 

The act of catching a Pokemon is a physical grind as well, with little to no reward for repeating the same, mundane action. The "random" element of whether a Pokemon stays in the ball or not is NOT a reward if it stays caught, but a perceived random PUNISHMENT for doing the correct action. 

This is terrible game design.













Harvest Moon and Animal Crossing-type games:
I've always found these types of games to be incredibly interesting. The developers managed to take a concept that is inherently boring in concept (build a cartoon farm, build a cartoon house), and created a endering franchise out of it. 

The grind: 
Move your character around the farm to repeat the same farming tasks to make more money, to build a better farm/house, to make more money. Tasks involve running around trying to optimize your time in your virtual day to keep your farm running smoothly. 

Reasons to play: 
Earning money allows you to buy better tools.
Better tools allow you to farm more efficiently. 
Even better tools may allow you to unlock new areas to make your farm bigger. 
Successful farms allow you to build reputation with the neighbors or nearby village. 
Better reputation with certain characters allow you to build relationships with certain characters.
As you progress, the base rules of the game never change.  The farm will always be the farm. Dirt is never harder to till, seeds are never harder to plant, crops are never harder to pick.  Your character is simply getting better and doing things more efficiently.
The grind is "fun" because the player inherently UNDERSTANDS that the grind is necessary to achieve a longer term goal. The moment that the overarching goal loses its appeal, the grind is dropped. So in this case, if the player ever asks him/herself "why do I care about this village," the magic is lost, and the player will probably stop playing the game. 


Now let's compare that quick summary with its mobile counterpart: Farmville (and its clones)
Mobile game developers have boiled the game down to its simplest mechanics to a great initial success, only for the trend to die off. 
Why? Boiling down the mechanics to mindless taps take out the meditative aspect of a full game as Harvest Moon, and even substantially reduces any sort of personalization with the "farm" that you build. 

The grind: 
Plant things on your farm by tapping. Wait a number of minutes or hours in realtime to tap and collect them for more coins. Repeat to buy better plants that provide more money. 
Repeat ad nauseum. 

Reasons to play:
The excitement of seeing what new crops are unlocked when you unlock the next level or amass enough coins keeps things fresh. The combination of tap execution + realtime waiting encourages short game sessions with increased frequency (2min sessions x 10 per day, for example). The short game sessions foster a low commitment, which make the action potential to begin a session much lower.  The short repeated game sessions keep the player playing. 

(I wonder if there's a way to survey players and plot how many hours players believe they've played vs. how many actual hours they've spent in-game.) 

By design, the entire game is a grind, relying completely on the player's addiction to the ever-so-slight dopamine rush that people get when rewarded. These game rely on the small percentage of the entire user database that DO spend money on these games, and analyze the data to keep those users engaged.  There IS no overaching long-term goal from a player perspective.
