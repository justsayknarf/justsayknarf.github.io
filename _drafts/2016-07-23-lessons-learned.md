It's been sometime now, but I realized I never truly chronicled the lessons learned from my projects. 

- Documenting Assumptions
- Use Actionable Language
- Keep Moving
- Inexperience Isn't Necessarily Bad

Documenting assumptions
=====

You're not going to have all the information you want, but you'll need to make a decision. If you have engineering resources that need to be utilized, you can't afford to be paralyzed by the lack of information. You'll need to make progress in some direction.  

Create an assumptions page that can be made public to your team. PMs need to be able to answer the WHYs for anything that's built, and lead the team in the right direction whenever something new is built. Hard data is the best reason, but when that data is lacking, and when time might not be on your side, lay down cairn at the fork in the road, and keep going. 

When the assumption is documented, the team understands that this is the current path the team is going down. It doesn't matter at this point if anyone disagrees at this point. The PM takes responsibility for the choice, but the assumption is written down, so if it ends up being a mistake, that choice can be revisited.  This is the benefit of iterating quickly, and failing fast.  If someone wants to hold on to a "I told you so" moment (a different problem in its own), let them, but the fact remains that the naysayers were not influential enough to sway the team otherwise, and the roadblock is cleared. 

Don't assume that your team will just magically UNDERSTAND whatever you're trying to accomplish. Trust must be built (I learned this the hard way). When structure needs to be provided through the noise, the PM breaks down the issues into actionable items, and provides the appropriate context and reasoning behind each decision for each person that might be involved. 

The challenge is to be efficient in your own work, and be able to communciate what information each team member needs to know. 

Work as a team. 

Use of actionable language
======
"I need this ASAP" vs "I need this for a meeting at 4pm tomorrow, and I'll be working it into my slidedeck at 1pm."

Giving people context and a means to directly respond makes things smoother, and shows that you respect their time as well as your own. As a PM you understand what prioritization is, so you should understand that each of your team members has his or her own prioritizations to make as well. 

The vaguer the context, the harder it is to priortize, and PMs are all too familiar with vague context. Don't be part of the problem by passing down vague requests. 

The PM's job is to make the abstract tangible. 

Be clear. Be concise.  Remember we're all human. Mostly.

Teams driven by logic
======
To some abstract extent, the PM is engineering the team to work at their most efficent manners. The PM must understand how each member communicates best, what sorts of inputs they take, and what sorts of outputs they spit back out. And as the PM, you are the integration middleware that makes sure each part can talk to each other with minimal effort. 

This is why communication is key. 



Importance of Team
===

This one is obvious, but is even more important when dealing with new products that need to move fast. 

The broadest point to make, but, a simple dynamic that can make a break progress. 

What does team mean?  What are the best teams? 

Teams without ego. Teams with great communication. Teams with respect.

Look, when you're building a team, you obviously want to build a team based off of experience. Those with experience will have encountered the same issues your team is going through now, and will know what to do or what not to do. But what's even more important, in my opinion, is the recognition when it applies. 

Every project will have hiccups. That's unavoidable. If you have
