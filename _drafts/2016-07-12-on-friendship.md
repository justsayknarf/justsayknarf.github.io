Plenty of people have blogged about why it's so hard to maintain friendships the older you get.  It IS hard.  People's lives move in different directions, people move to different places, people's statuses change.  And yet, I find that people often have a really hard time making new, MEANINGFUL relationships in new environments.

I really wish it weren't the case in big cities like San Francisco, but there are times where I feel it to be overwhelmingly true.

Do you ever sigh to yourself, thinking: "I miss those days that we would just... hang out, you know?"

In a city where everyone is optimizing for time, optimizing for Instagram hearts, perceived social value, the best Snapchat story, etc, where does a good, solid conversation lie in the priorty of things?

Is this specific to San Francisco?
====

I don't think so; I'm fairly certain that it happens all over.  But honestly, I wouldn't be surprised at all if San Francisco was one of the worst offenders.  

We're inundated with the success stories of Youtube stars, the latest app that's going viral, the latest billionaire that's under 30. 

The Bay Area is the central hub of "innovation".  Whether or not the idea is great, the bay area is the place to be to test it out.  It's COOL to be ahead of the curve on trends, and with the rise of social media presence, these trends just all happen to be tech-based.  

San Francisco is one of the biggest melting pots of ambition, jealousy, showmanship, status, and money.

<a class="image right"><img src="http://millennialceo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Social-Currency1.jpg"></a>

Earning our social currency in Facebook/Snapchat likes and hearts, our generation is slowly kowtowing to our social networks to determine what the definition of fun is.  

While you're wrapped in your blanket burrito scrolling through your social network's highlight reel, it's only natural to feel a sense of incompetence, a need to prove that your life is equally as cool. 

Our generation's social engineering has gotten so efficient that every social decision is now a pre-screened, data-driven analysis, optimized for "fun". There's no time for a 3 1/2 Yelp star restaurant when there's a 4 star restaurant right next to it. Why go to any coffeeshop, when you can go to the coffeeshop with the BEST baristas. 

And as a result, we subconciously soften our grip on our identity, a sense of who we are, forgetting what it was like to do things simply because we wanted to.

With time being as limited as ever, it's hard to open yourself to the "risk" of a sub-par experience. 

No wonder it's harder to make new friends. 

Friendships

Remember when having the same favorite pizza topping was enough to forge a friendship of unbreakable loyalty?

As children, we never had to look for a REASON to connect with another human being.  

However, we quickly find reasons to separate ourselves from others, constantly finding reasons NOT to associate with others. Things that were different would be teased; not having the latest cool toy was a reason to be ridiculed. Eventually we figure out a way to navigate the social world with our own set of rules, a way to live through your life in a way you feel comfortable.  

Fast forward 20 years; you're potentially thrust into a new world, that comfort disappears, and social media is there as a glowing reminder that it exists for else... but you.  

College friends have moved away or settled down, and friendships you made recently feel superficial, not quite like the relatively carefree days of college.  Like... you feel like you COULD be good friends with the new friends, but you just think it just wouldn't be the same. 

But that... that right there is the fallacy. 

I don't think it's necessarily hard for friends to move up in tiers. I just think that we're not aware of the effort it involves. For a lot of people, friendships just come "naturally".  But it's clear that as you get older: it takes conscious effort to make and maintain a relationship.  

In the past, in college dorms, in high school, on the street you grew up with, running into people just happened. By proximity, you would see the same people over and over, and you would hang out with the group of people you liked over and over.  The structure of your life put you in the same proximity of these people again and again. Nobody NEEDED to schedule anything for your group of people to just hang out.  It would "just happen". 

When you're thrown into the post-college world, the game changes.  Your available socializing time is proportioned completely differently. Your day is focused on work; socializing is limited to your coworkers. You only have so much energy now that work is over. Gym? Friends? Dates? Career advancement?  Whatever it is, you are committing your night to, so it better be good. 

The more choices you have, the better chances of a good night you'll have. If you secretly just want to stay home, at least you know you were asked to be somewhere. You just wanted the option to go out, after all.

If this sounds familiar to you at all, you should be able to see why friendships can be harder to maintain now. Time has become a scarcer resource.  New relationships are suddenly all Tier 3 relationships, but you're looking for Tier 1, and, understandibly, you're looking for loyalty.  

That sort of loyalty you're looking for typically has or had YEARS to develop, and you're disappointed it isn't there immediately.

Don't be part of the problem
===

How can you fix this? I've thought about this a lot more in the past years, and I've been trying to do this with my own life. 

Create priorities in your life, and stick to them. Convince yourself that if you are progressing in a forward direction with that priority, you've succeeded. 

If you are taking a new class, take a new class in something you're interested in. You are making progress in learning a new skill. If you meet someone new, cool, maybe you can practice that skill together. 

If a friend invites you to something, remember that this is a person that has made effort to reach out to you, an effort that you might not have had the effort to do in the first place. Evaluate the event with the added human element and perspective. 

Maybe reach out to someone you haven't talked to in awhile to grab a drink. It's weird; the person might at worst think "Hm I wonder why he/she is doing this, that's weird." But that's about it. Send the message and forget about it. You've done all you can do. 

Maybe your friends are slightly scattered.  Be the one that initiates the kicking of the backs. New Netflix show is out? Gather people to watch it.  Because why not. Did you used to do this in the dorms? Why not do it now?  Give your friends the option to DO something. There's a huge difference between "Hey we should hang out sometime" and "Hey I'm going to figure out how to make ice cream this weekend. Want to join?" 

Get out of the "just happened" mentality: don't be a passive player in your own life. The problem with "just happened" mentality in relationships is that it denies us the opportunity to take an active role in what we truly want.  It makes us only react to what has happened,  If both people sit around waiting for the phone to ring... that connection will never be made. Both people will answer the other phones that ARE ringing.  

And how would other people know how often your phone is ringing?
