The Myers Briggs Indicator.

According to Wikipedia, the Myersâ€“Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is 

> an introspective self-report questionnaire designed to indicate psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions.

You've probably heard of it before, and personally, I think it's been one of the reasons why the introvert has gotten as much celebration as it has in the past few years.
