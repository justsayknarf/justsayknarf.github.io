To start, I want to make this clear: I like Twitch. I love what it is, what it stands for, and I get the appeal. 

I've had friends ask me what the point of it all was. Questions like: "So... you just... watch someone ELSE play video games?" followed by a puzzled look, sometimes combined with a shrug and admittance that they would just never "get it".  

And this is where I begin to squirm.  It's hard to GET Twitch if you aren't in the gaming community already. It's even HARDER to understand if you're trying to figure it out. 

Twitch completely disrupted streaming entertainment back when it was justin.tv, and has become a household name in the gaming community.  It has the potential of being THE household name for ALL streaming, but I think there are some serious points that need to be addressed before this happens, starting with the User Experience. 

Namely, the experience of a New User.

While Twitch may be doing a great job attracting new users and getting the name out there, I wouldn't be surprised if conversion rates were lower than expected. 

The experience for a new user is somewhat intimidating. 



But one thing that I still haven't wrapped my head around... is the Twitch chat.
