I currently live in San Francisco, one of the most diverse cities, and a city that celebrates its food offerings and California-fusion, farm-to-table, organic, free-range, vegan, hidden-gem restaurants.

There are SO many restaurants out there, and Yelp is my go-to app to find out what to eat. But, being a user for however many years I've been using it, I still find... SOMETHING clunky about it.  It does what it needs to do, but something seems a bit dated, and I wanted to think WHY it did. 

It's easy to point out things that could use an update, but I wanted the challenge to see if I could explain to myself what needed change.

So here we go.

Quick Statistics on Yelp
========================
Monthly unique desktop unique visitors: **77 million**  
Monthly unique mobile web unique visitors: **69 million**  
Monthly unique mobile app unique users: **21 million**  
**70%** of searches on Yelp that came from mobile devices across the globe.  
**58+%** of Yelp content (reviews and photos) was generated on the Yelp app.  ([source](https://www.yelp.com/factsheet))

Yelp app users were more than **10 times as engaged** as website users based on number of pages viewed.  ([source](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/yelp-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2015-financial-results-300216659.html))

From these numbers, it does look like Yelp is focusing a lot of mobile right now. But the curious thing is the trend of the graph.

Desktop usage seems to be running flat. Without proper numbers, I won't say that it's actually stagnant or whatever, but it sure does look it. SOMEONE should still be manning the helm of the desktop application. While the numbers do show mobile as trending, it doesn't explain to me why desktop being ignored.  

You can argue that users simply find it more useful to be using it on mobile over desktop. People are out and about, and need to find something near them. That makes sense. But it doesn't explain the DROP in users in the last two years. Perhaps there are simply more mobile/tablet devices now in households, or people simply can't be bothered to use their desktop if they are more than 5 feet away from it.  I'm not sure I completely buy that argument though.  I think there are ways to drive more desktop users, but it's simply unclear to me what Yelp's current strategy with desktop is. 

The Yelp Social Network?
========================

Let's compare the landing pages for a user logged in, and a user that hasn't.  
<div class="row uniform">
	<div class="6u">
	<span class="image fit"><img src="/images/yelp-home-in.jpg"></span> 
	</div>
	<div class="6u">
	<span class="image fit"><img src="/images/yelp-home-out.jpg"></span>
	</div>
</div>

The pages are fairly different between a logged-in user and a non-logged-in user.  I had never really noticed how different the homepage was until now, actually, and now I have a bunch of questions, for these panels I'm presented with: Your Next Review, Recent Activity, Review of the Day, and Events. 

Your Next Review is up and center in a highlighted callout box. I've never written a review before, and I don't plan to. In fact, I'm not even sure where that specific coffeeshop is that it's prompting me to review. *Why would it prompt me to review a place I've potentially never been to?* 

What is Review of the Day? How is this chosen? Why was it chosen? *Why was the Review of the day a review from 11/17/2015?*  

Why is Recent Activity of people I don't know? Oh I see, it's of things "near me".  What is "near" though? It simply feels like it's information about people I don't care about, because the main identifier is the user that added it, like my facebook feed. A feed full of people I don't know. 

I'm not much of a contributor of Yelp, so it's apparent that this homepage might not be tailored for people like me. I typically see Yelp as a restaurant/food search engine, and that's it. There's no social network aspect to this for me; that's what facebook/instagram/snapchat is for. 

![I'm going to get so many likes](https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-LH781_NYINST_P_20151117151507.jpg)

So what is Yelp trying to do with this page then?

Okay okay. Going "under the fold" I see "New Businesses in San Francisco" and "Best of Yelp: San Francisco". Now THIS is the first bit of relevant information to me, personally. I'm going to Yelp with the intent to find a restaurant by some means.  New Restaurants and Best Of lists are much more likely to influence my decision than my non-existent Yelp social network.  Granted, I'm going straight for the search bar anyway, so perhaps it doesn't matter ALL that much.

All of this anecodotal evidence brings me to this claim:

**Yelp doesn't encourage users to explore the site for any other reason BUT to use it as a search engine.**

What does this mean?
====================

To me, it means an oversight on user engagement. If the goal is to keep the user engaged, there needs to be there needs to be a reason why a user would be encouraged to create an account. Once created, the user should be immediately rewarded with all the benefits of being an account holder, and be reminded as such.  And, hopefully, the more engaged the user chooses to be, the more the user gets out of it.

There are phases for a user to be deeply engaged with a product, and the user needs to be provided value all along the way. If the barrier of entry is too high, then that value needs to be worth the effort, or the user won't bother. 

It's important to note first though: *Active users and engaged users are NOT the same thing.*

Engage
======
![engage](http://ecologyofeducation.net/wsite/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/picard-588x448.jpg)  

So what does it mean to engage a user? From app to app, it's up to the team to decide and optimize on. 

From [this post on knowtify.io](http://blog.knowtify.io/four-steps-for-creating-a-user-engagement-score/), 

> "What is an engaged customer of [our product]?"  
They should answer with something like, "An engaged user of [our product] does X, Y, Z."

So let's take a look at potential Engagement Activities for Yelp:

* Search for restaurant/business, read reviews.
* Call business through Yelp. 
* Find directions to business through Yelp. 
* Logged in
* Wrote a review
* Shared a photo
* React to (like, compliment) a review
* Viewed an event
* Saved a bookmark
* Sent a message?
* Started a Conversation? 

Which one of these even need a user to be logged in? And, on another note, which one of these benefit from users creating the content? 

I think Yelp has already done a great job in getting traffic in the lurkers of the site; the ones that are just there to find the information they want and get out are successfully doing just that. But what about the ones that are actually creating the content? What are the numbers of engaged content creators?  

According to the [1% rule of Internet Culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture)), 1% of the users of a website actively create new content, while 99% lurk. If Yelp is trying to foster a community, I hope that they meet at least 1%. But who knows, it might not be on Yelp's roadmap to create a better community.

But with the [merit](http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2015/08/i-cant-stop-reading-these-one-star-yelp-reviews-national-parks) of a single Yelp review holding [less and less respect](http://insidescoopsf.sfgate.com/blog/2014/09/17/richmond-restaurant-owner-encourages-bad-yelp-reviews/), I think Yelp could stand to redesign some of its pages, and up the user engagement.

Focusing on the mobile app now is smart, and the numbers show. I don't want to say the web app NEEDS to catch up, but Yelp could stand to gain a LOT more usage if there was a reason to.
