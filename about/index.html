		Software developer turned product manager, always seeking best practices, processes, and efficiencies. Casually obssessed with the intangible elements of good design. A devout believer in solid foundations leading to a better result in all aspects, whether it be products or any other skill in life.  Relentlessly curious about human tendencies and thought processes, with a everlasting goal to live a deliberate life. </p>

			Small project teaching myself node.js.  A small app that scrapes the calendar page of a concert venue, and provides a 30 second preview for each artist via the Spotify API.
