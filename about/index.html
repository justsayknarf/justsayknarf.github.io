				The result of playing around with the paper.js and howler.js libraries. Use keyboard (select letters and space bar) to interact.  </p>

				<p> This was a quick project after listening to a friend play the hang drum for the first time. It made me curious what it was about the hang drum that produced such calming sounds. A digital representation does not hold a modicum of light to the powerful serenity of the actual instrument, but I wanted to see what would happen if the similar sounds were used.

				<p>
				Small project teaching myself node.js.  A small app that scrapes the calendar page of a concert venue, and provides a 30 second preview for each artist via the Spotify API.</p>

				<p>Things to add: Support for other concert venues. Support for popular music festivals. Support for Spotify Playlist Creation. UI snazziness.</p>
