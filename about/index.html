					<h2>This guy.</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Software developer turned product manager, fill-in-the-gapper, always seeking best practices, processes, and efficiencies. Casually obssessed with the intangible elements of good design. A devout believer in solid foundations leading to a better result in all aspects, whether it be products or any other skill in life.  Relentlessly curious about human tendencies and thought processes, with a everlasting goal to live a deliberate life. </p>
				<p>In his spare time, Frank enjoys climbing rocks the hard way. He also enjoys taking the occasional picture or two to pad his future photography portfolio. </p>

					<h2>This site.</h2>

				<p>This site is being served with Jekyll, hosted on Github Pages.</p>
				<p>This site is meant to be a fun platform for me to explore and learn. Continuing to add features bit by bit, pixel by pixel, page by page. I wanted to avoid Wordpress, Joomla, Squarespace, or any other CRM/website generator to be able to easily look behind the curtain without too much trouble, and be able to easily tweak without too much hand-holding.</p>
				<p>The result is... pretty much what you're looking at.  Various libraries, random tweaks here and there. All fun.</p>

				<p> SITE TODOS:
				<ul>
				<li class="complete">Update landing page.</li>
				<li class="complete">Update photo portfolio styles.</li>
				<li class="complete">Add Google analytics?</li>
				<li>Fix image links in sidebar.</li>
				<li>Get Tags/Categories working. </li>
				<li>Look at alternative hosting options?</li>
				</ul>
