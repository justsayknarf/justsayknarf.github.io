					<h2>This site.</h2>
				</header>
				<p>This site is being served with Jekyll, hosted on Github Pages.</p>
				<p>This site is meant to be a fun platform for me to explore and learn. Continuing to add features bit by bit, pixel by pixel, page by page. I wanted to avoid Wordpress, Joomla, Squarespace, or any other CRM/website generator to be able to easily look behind the curtain without too much trouble, and be able to easily tweak without too much hand-holding.</p>
				<p>The result is... pretty much what you're looking at.  Various libraries, random tweaks here and there. All fun.</p>

				<p> SITE TODOS:
				<ul>
				<li class="complete">Update landing page.</li>
				<li class="complete">Update photo portfolio styles.</li>
				<li class="complete">Add Google analytics?</li>
				<li>Fix image links in sidebar.</li>
				<li>Get Tags/Categories working. </li>
				<li>Look at alternative hosting options?</li>
				</ul>

					<h2><a href="https://justsayknarf.github.io/HangDrummer/index.html">Hang Drummer.</a></h2>

				<p>
				The result of playing around with the paper.js and howler.js libraries. Use keyboard (select letters and space bar) to interact.  </p>

				<p> This was a quick project after listening to a friend play the hang drum for the first time. It made me curious what it was about the hang drum that produced such calming sounds. A digital representation does not hold a modicum of light to the powerful serenity of the actual instrument, but I wanted to see what would happen if the similar sounds were used. I'm fairly positive that the notes in the sound samples that I found are not the standard tuning of most hang drums, but it was what I could find at the time.
