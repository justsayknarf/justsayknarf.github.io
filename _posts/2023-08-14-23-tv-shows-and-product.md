So I just finished binging Ted Lasso. 

I was a little slow on the uptake - I didn't catch the wave when it first came out, providing the needed virtual hug that everyone needed through a time of distress. 

But shoot, now that I caught on, for the last two weeks, it was the warm blanket that kept me safe on my couch through the nights. 

For the initiated, Ted Lasso, the "fluffy towel straight out of the dryer" TV show, is about a wholesome midwestern American that is hired to coach football (or soccer) for AFC Richmond, a fictional football club in England. 

Of course, hijinks ensue.

But unlike most shows, it is the power of kindness, optimism, good intentions, empathy, and listening that shines through and wins thoughout the series.

It is about a leader coming into an unknown environment and teaching others to be kind. 

It's kind of like the team building that product managers do. Kind of. 

Here's a comparison that no one asked for of Ted Lasso characters to product roles/archetypes. 

# Ted Lasso - The Empathetic Leader:
At the heart of the show is the titular character, Ted Lasso, an American football coach turned British soccer manager. Ted's key strength lies in his unwavering empathy and genuine care for his team. 

He initially inherits a team that immediately doubts his very presence. Ted remains unrattled by the doubt and sticks true to what he knows and sets a clear vision for the team to follow. Through the magic of television, he knows exactly what everyone needs and says the perfect thing at the perfect time for people to leave inspired and feel better about themeselves. He then lets the results speak for themselves, and credits all success to the team.

In product management, fostering a strong relationship with your team and stakeholders is paramount. Understanding the needs and motivations of each team member can lead to better collaboration, higher morale, and ultimately, more successful product outcomes. Ted reminds us that being a great leader means being more than just a strategist; it's about being a compassionate and approachable mentor. 

Note: Ted is almost proud of how little he knows about the sport he's coaching, which personally took me out of it. It often helps to display SOME competence in the field instead of just being the golden retriever that everyone loves. 

# Coach Beard - The Data-Driven Strategist:
Coach Beard, Ted's loyal assistant coach, is the embodiment of the analytical mind in the world of product management. He quietly observes, collects data, and crafts well-thought-out strategies. 

In product management, having a data-driven approach is essential. From conducting market research to analyzing user feedback, leveraging data allows product managers to make informed decisions, identify trends, and adjust product strategies accordingly.

Note: Beard is also demonstrates unwavering support to Ted in front of others, but is not afraid to speak his mind behind closed doors. 

# Roy Kent - The Customer Advocate:
Roy Kent, the team's seasoned veteran player, may be tough on the outside, but he's fiercely protective of his teammates. As a product manager, being a strong advocate for your customers is crucial. Just like Roy stands up for his teammates, product managers must stand up for their users. Understanding their pain points, desires, and expectations will drive product decisions that prioritize customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Note: He's also... passionate. And ornery. And curses a lot. But he knows the game, and knows the players. 

# Nate Shelley - The Rising Star:
Nate Shelley, a timid and underappreciated kit man at the start of the series, evolves into a confident and influential member of the team. This transformation reflects the journey of a junior product manager growing into a leadership role. Like Nate, every product manager begins somewhere and learns through experience. Embracing challenges, learning from mistakes, and continuously seeking personal growth are key ingredients for success in product management.

Through his journey, he lashes out, feeling unnoticed or underutilized -- missing the bigger picture. He has the insight and the IDEAS, but lacks the consistency and experience to INFLUENCE. When he does have the opportunity to manage a team (spoilers, I suppose), he is successful, but he struggles to find his voice, and struggles to create a safe environment where all can contribute.

# Keeley Jones - The UX Designer:
Keeley Jones, a glamorous model and a supportive girlfriend to Roy Kent, shows us that appearances can be deceiving. Beyond her outward persona, she proves to be intuitive and perceptive, much like a UX designer. In product management, creating exceptional user experiences is vital for product success. Keeley's ability to understand people and connect with them emotionally highlights the importance of user research and designing products that resonate with the target audience. Her innate understanding of club and player image allows her to champion and influence her audience. 

# Rebecca Welton - The Business Leader:
Rebecca Welton, the shrewd and determined owner of the soccer club, brings a unique perspective to the world of product management as a visionary business leader who might not be well-versed in the technical intricacies of the product itself. Her journey from a place of limited technical understanding to becoming an influential force within the team's success offers valuable lessons for product managers navigating the intersection of business and technology.

Rebecca's collaboration with her technical experts, such as Coach Beard and Higgins, showcases the importance of building a cross-functional team. Just as she relies on their expertise to make informed decisions about the team, product managers must collaborate closely with their development, design, and other technical teams to ensure a product's success. Rebecca's approach highlights the significance of fostering a harmonious working relationship between business and technical stakeholders.

Rebecca starts off the show as an antagonist, intending on sabotaging the team by hiring Ted. While this does not translate quite as well to a product team in a successful business, it can absolutely translate to leadership teams that are completely detached from the product team's day to day, stopping only to ask "Why aren't we winning?" 

# Conclusion:
Ted Lasso's charming characters provide us with more than just laughs; they offer relevant lessons that can be applied to the dynamic world of product management. From Ted's empathy-driven leadership to Coach Beard's data-driven strategies, each character exemplifies important traits that resonate with product managers aiming to create successful products.

By drawing inspiration from these characters, product managers can navigate challenges with a fresh perspective, build strong relationships with their teams and customers, make data-backed decisions, and embrace growth opportunities. Just as the show's tagline suggests, "Believe," the journey of a product manager, like that of a football team, is rife with ups and downs, but with the right mindset and approach, they can overcome obstacles and achieve remarkable success.
