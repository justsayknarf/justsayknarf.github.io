**Note: I did recently watch a couple movies in the Fast and Furious franchise, so I'm more than primed to lavishly celebrate all forms of loyalty and family and trust. I may be a bit biased about all of this.**

I have mixed emotions about not having a "hierarchy" and "everyone having a say" when it comes to projects.  Everyone SHOULD have a voice on a team. It wouldn't be a team otherwise.  However, I DON'T believe everyone's opinions are always correct. 

Now let me clarify here. I'm not trying to establish a hierarchical system in any team, nor am I saying that one person's opinions should always be weighed more than others.  What I'm trying to say is that while everyone's opinion SHOULD matter, everyone needs to TRUST in their team members and their respective roles as well.  There's a reason why design-by-committee should be avoided by all costs.

With any new feature, I always find that the earlier I involve the designer, the smoother the designs come out to be. What I've always done is lay out to the team what it we're trying to accomplish, and have the data ready to present should the team want to see it. 

Designers will always benefit from seeing how the feature request came to be, as the motives will certainly affect the design. Equally, developers will come to understand what it is exactly the team is trying to build, what assumptions may have been made, and be able to create a feature with a foundation that is easier to iterate off of.  

Now, building broad and vague features as a catch-all solution is not correct either. It's up to the product manager to know how to balance a zeroed-in focused approach vs a broad one. I believe that it's the PM's role to provide the reasoning behind any decision to all levels, and be able to communicate at the level the team member cares about. It's up to the PM to ask the correct questions, cut the fluff, locate the essentials, and execute.  

Product managers should be experts in the "why" of the specs, and be able to work with the team, lean on the expertise of the each respective team member, and be able to articulate the "why" behind the "how" and "when". 

Respect the process, and trust in your team. Designers are there to design; they shouldn't have to guess what the PM wants. Similarly, developers are there to architect and build. A minor decision that can be made based off understanding the motives will prevent days of technical debt caused by a slight shift in strategy in the future, with no cost to the present. 

The PM acts in the best interest of the product. Assuming the PM has a capable team, the team needs to trust in the PM's decisions, and the PM needs to trust the team to help him/her make them.
