It's been sometime now, but I realized I never truly chronicled the lessons learned from my projects. This is for me to review, and to learn. I'll continue to add to these, and hopefully it will help others too. 

These probably apply the most to startups just starting to build out their product team, as tiny startups don't really need a designated PM until communication starts to break down.

Asking Why
====

As a PM, you're going to hear a lot of things from different sources, and have you're going to have a lot of data to parse. It's often up to you to understand that data and translate it into relevant pieces of information. 

Everyone interprets information differently, and it may fall to you to understand that. Keep asking why to the answers you get from your questions.  Sales may say "The customer needs feature X now" can be clarified. How hard feature X is to implement can be clarified. Are there basic versions of feature X that are simpler? Can feature X already be done already? What does "need now" really mean?  Are they using it tomorrow?  

"I need it now" may very well translate to "The customer needs the most basic functionality of x (which we can do in 3 days) by the time they go live next year."  


Playing the Hand You're Dealt
====

Obviously not all startups are a mess, but sometimes it can be tough to step back and understand what it is you know and don't know. And sometimes it can be even harder to balance that with just *getting it done*.  Problems with missing data and processes can't always be magically fixed.  Those take iterations as well. Understand when to dive deep for that information and add structure to the growing company, and when to join the fracas and just make things happen.


Documenting assumptions
=====

You're not going to have all the information you want, but you'll need to make a decision. If you have engineering resources that need to be utilized, you can't afford to be paralyzed by the lack of information. You'll need to make progress in some direction.  

It's okay to make assumptions.  When you need to, make sure the team knows what you're doing.  For example, create an assumptions page that can be made public to your team. PMs need to be able to answer the WHYs for anything that's built, and lead the team in the right direction whenever something new is built. Hard data is the best reason, but when that data is lacking, and when time might not be on your side, lay down cairn at the fork in the road, and keep going. 

When the assumption is documented, the team understands that this is the current path the team is going down. It doesn't matter at this point if anyone disagrees at this point. The PM takes responsibility for the choice, but the assumption is written down, so if it ends up being a mistake, that choice can be revisited.  This is the benefit of iterating quickly, and failing fast.  If someone wants to hold on to a "I told you so" moment (a different problem in its own), let them, but the fact remains that the naysayers were not influential enough to sway the team otherwise, and the roadblock is cleared. 

If the data isn't there, don't assume that your team will just magically UNDERSTAND whatever it is you're trying to accomplish. Trust must be built (I learned this the hard way). When structure needs to be provided through the noise, the PM breaks down the issues into actionable items, and provides the appropriate context and reasoning behind each decision for each person that might be involved. 

The challenge is to be efficient in your own work, and be able to communciate what information each team member needs to know. 

Work as a team. 

Effective communication - Use of actionable language
======

"I need this ASAP" vs "I need this for a meeting at 4pm tomorrow, and I'll be working it into my slidedeck at 1pm."

Giving people context and a means to directly respond makes things smoother, and shows that you value their time as well as your own. As a PM you understand what prioritization is, so you should understand that each of your team members has his or her own prioritizations to make as well. 

The vaguer the context, the harder it is to priortize, and PMs are all too familiar with vague context. Don't be part of the problem by passing down vague requests. 

Your team isn't a pool of resources that you get to use on-demand. They all have work they're trying to prioritize themselves. Everyone has their own thing to do.

The PM's job is to make the abstract tangible. 

Be clear. Be concise.  Remember we're all human. Mostly.

Understand What Your Team Needs
======

To some abstract extent, the PM is engineering the team to work at their most efficent manners. The PM must understand how each member communicates best, what sorts of inputs they take, and what sorts of outputs they spit back out. And as the PM, you are the integration middleware that makes sure each part can talk to each other with minimal effort. 

This is why communication is key. 

Engineers don't write things instantly. Good code comes from the ground up. When you cut on time, you sacrifice on quality. Understand the tradeoffs. Maybe even code some stuff yourself to understand some of the challenges.  

Your designer isn't a genie that summons perfect design. Design takes iteration. Understand when the designer wants to be included in the process. If the designer is there to design, don't toss him/her with a wireframe and expect a perfect mockup in return.  

One of the challenges of the PM is to understand how each person communicates the best, and understand what sorts of information he or she is most receptive to. 


Importance of Team
===

This one is obvious, but is even more important when dealing with new products that need to move fast. 

It's the broadest point to make, but, a simple dynamic that can make a break progress. 

What does team mean?  What are the best teams? 

Teams without ego. Teams with great communication. Teams with respect.

You're the coach of the all-star <insert sports reference> team. You're also the cheerleader.  They'll still be able to play the game without you, and they're more capable at the actual doing of the task, but you help them win, and you guide them to victory. 

Inspire the team. Lead the team. 

If your team is inexperienced, recognize the inexperience.  Rookie team members will need mentorship. Try and make sure they find the mentorship they need.  If you're the rookie PM, be confident in what you know, and what you don't know. Know who you can turn to for help.

Your team doesn't need politics, because you are the one shielding them from it. 

Every project will have hiccups. That's unavoidable. But if you have the team working together, you learn from the mistakes, and succeed together.
