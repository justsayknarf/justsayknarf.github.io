This site is meant to be a place for me to share things I think are worth sharing to the world. My social media presence is typically rather small, as I tend to assume that my thoughts are simply my thoughts, and someone out there that is smarter and more expert has already said the same things, and more eloquently.  I suppose this blog will be a way to document my journey towards that very eloquence.  Why the manatee for now? Catchphrases aren't really my thing.

This page is (clearly) still under construction. Warning: Broken links and images abound. 

This is a result of playing with different CSS layouts and templates, finding what resources are available to create a quick blog-like website.  Currently powered with Jekyll and Github Pages. I suppose I could have used Wordpress, or a bunch of different options, but I wanted to explore all my options. In the interest of getting something OUT there lightweight without all the Wordpress overhead, or the complete automation of other platforms, I settled on Github pages for now, served with the built in Github Pages.

I may move it to a node stack for further practice deploying, but I think this will suffice for now.

Maybe I'll dig up the old under construction gif from the old angelfire pages...
