I currently live in San Francisco, one of the most diverse cities, and a city that celebrates its food offerings and California-fusion, farm-to-table, organic, free-range, vegan, hidden-gem restaurants.

There are SO many restaurants out there, and Yelp is my go-to app to find out what to eat. But, being a user for however many years I've been using it, I still find... SOMETHING clunky about it.  It does what it needs to do, but something seems a bit dated, and I wanted to think WHY it did. 

It's easy to point out things that could use an update, but I wanted the challenge to see if I could explain to myself what needed change.

So here we go.

Quick Statistics on Yelp
========================
Monthly desktop unique visitors: **77 million**  
Monthly mobile web unique visitors: **69 million**  
Monthly mobile app unique users: **21 million**  
**70%** of searches on Yelp that came from mobile devices across the globe.  
**58+%** of Yelp content (reviews and photos) was generated on the Yelp app.  ([source](https://www.yelp.com/factsheet))

Yelp app users were more than **10 times as engaged** as website users based on number of pages viewed.  ([source](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/yelp-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2015-financial-results-300216659.html))

From these numbers, it does look like Yelp is focusing a lot of mobile right now. But the curious thing is the trend of these graphs.

Take a look at the last graph in particular. Now I don't have the exact numbers, but it looks like desktop usage seems to be running flat. This is curious to me; SOMEONE should still be manning the helm of the desktop application, but given the lack of updates to the Yelp layout, it's possible that web app is getting ignored. The numbers suggest a focus of resources on developing mobile, but I'm not convinced that the web app is being forgotten. Maybe a grand redesign is in the works. Or maybe the web app is doing what it needs to do.  

Now you can argue that users simply find it more useful to be using it on mobile over desktop. People are out and about, and need to find something near them; they pull out their phones, look things up.  That makes sense. But I don't believe that's a valid excuse for a DROP in users in the last two years. 

I mean, we all know that these days, people simply can't be bothered to use their desktop if they are more than 5 feet away from it.  

![cantreach](http://www.laughtard.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/When-Im-lying-on-the-couch-and-cant-quite-reach-my-phone.gif)

With a rise in mobile and a decline in desktop users, I'm prone to believe that users are not using Yelp for any other reason OTHER than search.

Is this something to worry about? 

I think so. With Yelp facing [increasing competition with Google](http://www.businessinsider.com/analyst-says-yelp-traffic-could-decline-for-first-time-ever-2015-7), Yelp will continue to lose traffic to Google unless Yelp gives a reason for users to engage with the site for reasons other than search. 

If Yelp is losing traffic to Google search results, Yelp needs to capitalize on its biggest advantage: Yelp's community of reviews. Google may be all that's necessary if a user is searching for the location of a specific restaurant, but it will be the community of reviews that users look for when they don't know what they want to eat.

Without knowing what Yelp's current strategy for desktop, I'm going to take a look at the desktop pages, and see what parts need addressing.

The Yelp Social Network?
========================

Okay, so let's compare the landing pages for yelp.com, based on if we're logged in, and see what's going on. 


<div class="row uniform">
	<div class="6u image-caption">

Stream of consciousness start:

*What am I looking at here? Your Next Review, Recent Activity, Review of the Day, and Events. What is all of this?*

*"Your Next Review" is up and center in a highlighted callout box. I've never written a review before, and I don't plan to. Have I even been to that coffeeshop?*

*What is Review of the Day? How is this chosen? Why was it chosen? Also, why was the Review of the day a review from 02/22/2016?*  

*Why is Recent Activity of people I don't know? Oh it's "near me".  Who are these people?* 

*When did I add friends on Yelp, anyway? Did I connect this with Facebook?* 

*Scrolling down a bit...*

*Oh cool I see "New Businesses in San Francisco" and "Best of Yelp: San Francisco". THIS I can use, maybe.*

*Annnnd. That's it. Wait why am I logged in. All I want to do is find a restaurant and nothing here helps me do that really.*

Okay. Stream of consciousness over. 

All in all, I'm not sure what Yelp wants me to do after I login. The vast majority of the information on the home page is related to a Yelp social network I've never used before, and, on top of that, I have no idea why I'm seeing it. 

All of this anecodotal evidence brings me to this claim:

**Yelp doesn't encourage users to explore the site for any other reason BUT to use it as a search engine.**

What does this mean?
====================

To me, it means an oversight on user engagement. Yelp has operated on the idea that the act of writing reviews itself was incentive enough to create an account for so long that the current landing page for a user doesn't focus a user to do anything but search.  If the goal is to keep the user engaged, there needs to be a reason why a user should login at all. If the user just wants to search, there's no reason to create an account, and Yelp's growth will continue to be in danger.

It's important to note: *Active users and engaged users are NOT the same thing.*

But Yelp's success WAS its social element
=========================================

Yelp's social aspect of reviews was the reason for its wild success. Earlier review sites of the time attempted to compete by gathering anonymous reviews, but it was Yelp's social branding that allowed Yelp to be the "trustworthy" source of reviews. By forcing users to have a profile, it gave these anonymous reviews a name and a face, forcing each user to present their review as part of their personal branding. A mediocrely written review reflected poorly on the user, not the restaurant. 

Users were excited about this! The idea of building your social capital through your reviews was a good reason for users to hop on board, and the promise of Yelp Elite seealed the deal.  According to a study in 2011, **44% of all reviews on Yelp during the studyâ€™s timeframe were written by elite members.** *([source](http://searchengineland.com/yelp-crushed-citysearch-yahoo-why-google-stealing-yelps-playbook-78623))* Some of these particularly engaged users became Community Managers, and they threw exciting Yelp Elite events that really made the high quality reviews untouchable. 

And the psychology behind some of these Yelp Elite Squad members is that [they are doing good](http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/blog/business/2016/03/exclusive-phoenixs-yelp-elite-squad-members-talk.html). There is definitely an element of defending what Yelp stands for and helping out small business. 

The current layout reflects this mentality. The most important thing for a logged-in user is to quickly *write a review*. And then, assuming you're in love with writing reviews, it shows your social network of fellow reviewers.

So what is causing [all the fuss](http://www.wsj.com/articles/yelp-needs-some-help-1454866219) about user growth now? 

Yelp Elitist
============

I personally think the Yelp reviewer pool is running dry. I don't think people are as hyped as they were before about writing Yelp reviews.  The Yelpers who have been writing reviews will continue writing reviews, but beyond that, people aren't seeing the reason to join this Yelp community anymore. While Google continues to redirect restaurant listings to its own pages, everyone else will be drawn to whatever is most convenient.  

And I think Yelp has a lot working against it, due to some occasional bad publicity.  The [quality of certain Yelp Reviews][merit] now hold [questionable levels of respect][respect], and Yelp Elite doesn't quite have the same allure as it once did. That [one South Park episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFhDyZ4HFgY) (warning: NSFW South Park language) surely didn't help, either. The challenge to get more people to create quality content must be getting harder, as users are turning to their mobile devices to use the app. 

The increase in mobile usage is a reflection on the convenience of data access, and nothing else. 

If engagement is running low, Yelp needs to address what it means to be engaged with the app in the first place, and recognize that Yelp Elite doesn't mean what it did 5 years ago.  

**It's time to re-engage the Yelp non-elite.**
