So, first, what does it mean to engage a user? What does it mean to engage, and who are the users exactly?

<!--more-->

Obviously, from app to app, it's up to the team to decide and optimize on. 

From [this post on knowtify.io](http://blog.knowtify.io/four-steps-for-creating-a-user-engagement-score/), it's good to ask your team:

> "What is an engaged customer of [our product]?"  
They should answer with something like, "An engaged user of [our product] does X, Y, Z."

So let's take a look at some potential Engagement Activities for Yelp:

* Search for restaurant/business, read reviews.
* Call business through Yelp. 
* Find directions to business through Yelp. 
* View an event
* Log in
* Save a bookmark
* React to (like, compliment) a review
* Modify restaurant/business information
* Start a "Conversation"
* Share a photo
* Write a review

Yelp has already done a great job in bringing in traffic from the normal users of the site; the ones that are just there to find the information they want and get out are successfully doing just that. 

| These Yelpers are engaged, up to the point where they find what they need, **and then they leave**.

So what should an engaged user be?  What does Yelp's ideal user looks like? Yelp's ideal user IS a member of the Yelp Elite. A user that understands the Yelp cause, and is a **contributor to the content of Yelp**. It's the community of reviewers that Yelp celebrates, and without engagement from the contributors, Yelp's content atrophies. 

Yelp's goal should be to engage the common user in hopes of converting a user into a reviewer, into an **active contributor to Yelp's ecosystem**, whether that be curating existing Yelp information, sharing a photo, or, ideally, creating new content.  

So the next question becomes: how *does* a user go from lurker to a contributing member of Yelp's society?

Contributing back to society - Yelp edition
===========================================

Lurkers don't just instantly BECOME power users in a community, especially if the community has been around for some time. There is no magic switch that flips once a user creates an account. Users will create accounts out of curiosity, or if they're forced to. 

In the onset of any new social network, the first power users are typically the [innovators and early adopters](http://www.ondigitalmarketing.com/learn/odm/foundations/5-customer-segments-technology-adoption/), driven by the app's mission statement. They are quick to adopt anything and everything about the app, understanding that communities arise only through engagement, and will make that first leap willingingly with little suggestion.  

However, to continue to grow, we need to consider the behaviors of the rest of the populace after this core community has been established. Again, I think Yelp has done a great job in having the technology adopted as a reliable service, and the challenge now is to provide these lurkers enough incentive to stick around and give back. 

A social difficulty curve needs to be addressed when considering how a former lurker evolves into a power user. There should be reasons why a user would want to take the next step for every step up in "social difficulty". 

According to the [1% rule of Internet Culture][internet-culture], 1% of the users of a website actively create new content, 9% modify that content, while 90% lurk.  I'll just call these user-types Creators, Modifiers, and Lurkers. 

Let's break down the Engagement Activities from before into these user-types, and whether or not an account is needed to perform the activity. 

| **Activity** | **User type** | **Log in required** | 
|--- | :-: | :-: |
| Search for restaurant/business, read reviews. | Lurker | N |
| Call business through Yelp. | Lurker | N | 
| Find directions to business through Yelp. | Lurker | N |
| View an event | Lurker | N |
| Log in | Curious Lurker |  |
| Save a bookmark | Curious Lurker | Y |
| React to (like, compliment) a review | Modifier | N |
| Modify restaurant information | Modifier | N |
| Start a "Conversation" | Creator | Y |
| Share a photo | Creator | Y |
| Write a review | Creator | Y |

Several of these activities that encourage the act of "contributing" can be done without an account at all, which I think works against Yelp.  

While Innovators and Early Adopters may have no issue with contributing to the cause, the bulk of the users we're trying to convert need to be recognized and rewarded for all their actions. Without recognition, the user will wonder why creating an account was necessary at all, if not to simply give Yelp more data?  What is the value to the *user*?  

The Curious Lurker
==================

According to the 1% rule, 90% are lurkers. These are the users that enjoy using the site for the services that it immediately provides. They might see the community from the outside, looked through the metaphorical window, but they haven't stepped their foot in the door quite yet. They simply enjoy the content for what it is, and the lurker's engagement with the product solely lies on how much value the lurker gets out of it (i.e. how easy it is to find what restaurant to eat at).

If the goal is to entice the lurker to step inside and begin interacting with the community, there needs to be a reason for the lurker to want to do so.  There need to be benefits that the lurker can immediately reap while he/she is toying with the idea of being an active member. With new benefits in hand, the user will be more willing to explore the community, and explore all the social aspects.  

This is the [social difficulty curve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuG7mIpVFc0), which is brought up in game design for online multiplayer games.  Guiding the user, encouraging the user to take the next step when the user feels ready, allowing the user to come to a conclusion himself/herself based on all the pleasant experiences before: these are all methodically designed with the user in mind. In fact, many games eventually fail if they are not designed properly. 

Now obviously, the gamification card has been played out over the last few years, so I'm not necessarily talking badges, achievements, and progress bars.  That would be potentially force feeding a trite gamification idea without properly analyzing the situation. But the abstract idea of "progress" can still be applied. 

The path from lurker to Yelp Elite is not a short one for the reluctant user, but now that we've identified the path and user on the path, we can focus our efforts properly.

In Part 3, I'm going to dive deeper into this idea to see how this path might be improved.
