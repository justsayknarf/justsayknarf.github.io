A little bit of minimally structured thought ahead:

In the past, I would take ilk with any oft-repeated motivational or philosophical statement about life. I would hear the words, and think "okay well not ALL the time," finding exceptions, loopholes, and what have you. I would feel smart having found the exceptions to the rule, feeling better than the "masses" who so blindly follow these predetermined statements. 

But I realize now how closed off that sort of mentality _actually_ is. 

To be open-minded is to try and understand the intent behind these statements, and see how they might apply to you. 

Maybe it's from years of product thinking. Maybe it's empathy. 
Maybe it's Maybelline. 

# Community building and growth mindset

"You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with."

I remember when I first heard this, I was blown away. I immediately thought about who my 5 were and wondered if it applied to me. Was I happy about this? Disappointed? Does this rationalize any of the internal struggles I feel? 

I don't remember really coming to a conclusion then, but I've got thoughts now. 

Being the "average of the five people" is really just a variation on "You are the company you keep." And it's been stated time and time again you want to be surrounded by people that inspire you and help you grow. 

A younger me could have misinterpreted this to think "I need to get more friends that inspire me" or "I'm being held back by these people around me." 

Now, I simply believe that this is meant to be a guiding principle. It's important to understand what value each of these relationships brings you before you leap to any conclusion about a current relationship. 

Certain relationships might bring you comfort and calm. In a world where many things are uncertain, this might be crucial for you to even have the capacity to plan for your future. 

Certain relationships might inspire you to be more patient and giving. Certain relationships can be aspirational - you choose to be around them because they inspire you and show you that brighter future. 

As a world coming out of quarantine, it may seem that the company we've kept is more and more insulated. We were forced to spend years with a select bubble, socially isolating your network from others, likely developing more and more rigid mindsets, developing a sense of narcissism at a group level. 

I'm not sure, but I believe that empathy is a requirement for a healthy growth mindset. In order to believe that you can change, you have to be able to recognize not only what is different between you and others, but also accept why that is, why it's okay, and what you'd like to do about it. 

If you are surrounded by people that all claim they have a "growth mindset" but are all narcissists, are you able to recognize it? It would take an incredible amount of self-awareness to. 

While it is important to find community, it is the variety in opinion and approaches to life that push people to believe they are part of something larger. Community is required to feel safe - the tapestry and diversity in that community is what allows us to evolve. 

Coming out of a pandemic feels like coming out of the Fallout Vault, with a new world out there. Our communities were strained, and forcibly isolated. 

In a world where people are increasingly living their lives online, community building has become more important than ever.

Maybe this was a actually a post about narcissists. It's a little unclear to me. 

Growth mindset requires self-awareness. Narcissistic behavior can masquerade as self-awareness, but you'd only know that if you have empathy. The internet drives narcissitic behavior. Community brings a tapestry of people that have at least one thing in common. 

Life is tricky. Community is good.
