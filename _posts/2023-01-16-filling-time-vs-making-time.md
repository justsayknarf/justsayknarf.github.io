Be Proactive in Communication.

---

I've seen so many organizations struggle with this, and only seen a few succeed in instilling it in their organization's culture.

In concept, it's fairly simple. Be _proactive_ in communicating information, plans, developments, etc. Don't wait for people to ask you, be the one to tell _them_.

For example, in the development of a new feature, you learn that it will require an extra manual step to the onboarding process. You check if this is avoidable in any way, and you determine that this is the best path forward in order to ship the MVP of your features. You document your findings, and share this new development at the next sprint demo. Eventually, you reach the moment when you are launching the feature itself, and the onboarding team learns of this extra step and they feel blindsided, and continue to feel like they don't have a voice at the organization.

But that's strange, you feel that you did what you did -- you presented it at the sprint demo, and you had explicitly called it out then. You had also shared and circulated the documentation to the stakeholders as well, and given everyone a chance to see the new step. You even called this out in appropriate Slack channels. At previous organizations, everyone would've seen what they needed to see. So why are stakeholders surprised by this development now?

Part of being a product manager is making sure your communication is _effective_. Broadcasting information is one thing, but if no one is listening, then how effective is that communication?

Take some time to check in with your stakeholders on an individual level. What do they respond well to? What are their actual needs? It's incredibly easy to fall into the rhythm of ceremonies and pre-established meetings without realizing that the meetings are not serving their actual purpose. In an attempt to "be Agile" there is a blind adherence to _performing_ specific ceremonies without acknowledging whether they are serving the stakeholders themselves.

This has happened in some variation to me in EVERY organization I've been in, and it's important to remember that every organization is different, in a different stage of product culture and communication.

An additional note on this. It's important to balance the responsibility of communication with your colleagues. If you're like me, the _weight_ of all the responsibility can add up. Communicating, following up, iterating on the communication, confirming that the communication was received -- it's a lot of work. And at some organizations, it goes unnoticed or is not prioritized. These types of organizations tend to focus and reward individual output and less on outcome, and siloing communication is a survival mechanism. It's important to recognize when this happens for your own sanity. At some point, there is responsibility that is required on the stakeholders' end as well to respect and respond. It's important to remember to balance that weight so you're not personally overwhelmed by trying to communicate with people that aren't looking to be communicated with.
