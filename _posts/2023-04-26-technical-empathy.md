# Empathy in our culture
At its most basic level, empathy is simply awareness of the feelings and emotions of other people. It's one of the first things we demonstrate as we're developing: babies smiling back at their parents at a young age. It's something we're taught growing up (hopefully): understanding how actions impact others, and how it might make others _feel_. 

It's in our _primitive_ nature to only look out for ourselves, but as a society, we thrive because of our ability to socialize and be part of a greater whole. 

But that being said, now, more than ever, I believe we live in a culture that continues to discourage empathy. With social media being so prevalent, there is a subconcious undercurrent of economized attention that is now prevalent in our culture. As social media influencers fight for our attention, our feed-scrolling habits subconciously reinforce this economy. 

And at its worst, it feeds into a subconcious belief that you will not be heard unless that attention is demanded. 


>There’s a lot of talk in this country about the federal deficit.  But I think we should talk more about our empathy deficit – the ability to put ourselves in someone else’s shoes; to see the world through those who are different from us – the child who’s hungry, the laid-off steelworker, the immigrant woman cleaning your dorm room.

>As you go on in life, cultivating this quality of empathy will become harder, not easier.  There’s no community service requirement in the real world; no one forcing you to care.  You’ll be free to live in neighborhoods with people who are exactly like yourself, and send your kids to the same schools, and narrow your concerns to what’s going in your own little circle.

>Not only that – we live in a culture that discourages empathy.  A culture that too often tells us our principal goal in life is to be rich, thin, young, famous, safe, and entertained.  A culture where those in power too often encourage these selfish impulses.

# Some types of empathy

Cognitive 
Empathy by thought - understanding other people's perspectives by putting yourself in their shoes. Not necessarily feeling the emotion yourself, but at least being able to identify the emotion.

Emotional
Empathy by feeling - literally _feeling_ what other people feel, e.g. feeling sad when you see someone crying. 

Compassionate
Understanding someone's emotions and thoughts, and taking appropriate action to help. 

# Finding the balance

Cognitive empathy is the thinking portion, and emotional empathy is the feeling. 

Exercising cognitive empathy is important, but can be seen as too logical and unsympathetic. When someone has an emotional response to something, especially in the workplace, a cognitive empathetic response may be received as calling someone out - tackling emotion with more logic. 

Emotional empathy is also important, but overexercising it may be seen as too emotional. When it's not carefully regulated, this could even lead to burnout. Imagine a work environment where the team is stressed, and, as a result, the product manager starts to get even _more_ stressed. Not great. 

What I'm calling compassionate empathy is about finding the balance to leverage both this logic and emotion in order to understand those you collaborate with, and to support them while making good decisions. 

# Technical empathy and development teams

Empathy is more than just a feeling. It’s a skill and a tool that can be practiced and honed. What I'm calling _technical_ empathy is the ability to exercise compassionate empathy within technical teams. I believe it is beneficial to all to understand this and practice it whenever possible, as a lack of empathy in software development can lead to not only inefficient communication within the team, but also legacy systems that are difficult to work with. 

### Tactical applications

At a day to day level, how do you balance making the codebase functional while making it understandable? How might you make it easier for others to understand your thought process, and maybe even the constraints in your implementation? 

As a PM, it might be a little less obvious how you can help here, but there is still some empathy that can be practiced. If you've never coded before, you may not understand the slog of trying to understand a new codebase and how much time and mental energy it takes. So how do you familiarize yourself with that? How can you create the space for your development team so that you're not adding to that stress? How can you protect the team's time from other stakeholders that will inevitably push for tighter timelines? How can you communicate the team's progress when "familiarizing yourself with the codebase" is less quantifiable? And, on the other hand, how do you ensure that the progress is being made? 

As a quick aside, many agile/SDLC related frameworks all work to combat these issues - I believe that there is immense value in _understanding_ the reasoning behind why the frameworks are useful as opposed to just forcing the structure upon a team. 

### Strategic applications

At a strategic level, how do you balance developing against a legacy system that incurs a maintenance tax any time you touch it against developing a better, scalable solution? In many organizations, those defending the legacy system become labeled as those in the "old guard" that refuse to think bigger. On the other hand, those clamoring for a new solution may be labeled as "idealistic" and "not a team player". Both sides have plenty of valid points and concerns, and how much technical empathy is exercised can result in frustration and burnout if concerns aren't addressed, or excitement and collaboration.

In my experience, when these types of discussions happen, no one is _against_ a better, more efficient solution, so it's important to pull back the layers to understand why people have taken the hard stances they have. As the PM, you're the facilitator and can exercise the technical empathy to bring people together. Perhaps it's about just ensuring there is space for people to be heard. Or maybe it's about ensuring that there is a plan in place to address it. It's also about understanding that the incremental taxes being paid are increasingly imperceptible the further you are from the it. You've likely heard of the "boiling frog" and "death by a thousand paper cuts" and yet we're all susceptible to it. 

Technical empathy can help you identify human bias and assumptions that get baked into software systems and decision making and see the patterns and common pitfalls in development and scaling. 

# In practice
At the end of the day, technical empathy is not something that can be learned in a day. I believe it takes mindful practice and intent. 

I also believe this will become more and more important in the years to come. With the rise of AI-assisted development, the _articulation and intent_ behind development ideas will become the meat of strategic and tactical exchanges, as the development cost itself decreases over time.
