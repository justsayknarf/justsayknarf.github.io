Continued from [Part 1]({% post_url 2016-07-03-unsolicited-yelp-analysis %}) and [Part 2]({% post_url 2016-07-04-unsolicited-yelp-analysis %}) of my Unsolicited Yelp Analysis posts. 

Check those out first!  

Online communities are an interesting thing. In my last posts, I claimed that the current design does not encourage users to use the platform for anything BUT search, and that it's about time that this was addressed.

That's understandbly a bold claim from someone that only has anecodotal data and a very small sample size, but let's keep going anyway.  So let's take a look at why Yelp could focus more on the user's experience in the community, and what it takes for an online community to be successful.

<!--more-->

For any given online community to be successful over time, we should consider what psychological barriers a user might be presented with each step of the way, and design accordingly to help the user adjust. That is, we should consider the **social difficulty curve for engagement**. 

| I'm adopting this idea of the social difficulty curve from an [excellent Youtube video by the team from Extra Credits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_144385421&feature=iv&index=15&list=PLhyKYa0YJ_5CbUOb7kGRGS_g2NcsKhaaM&src_vid=QuG7mIpVFc0&v=QuG7mIpVFc0) (which I highly recommend watching), where they talk about the social difficulty curve in games, namely Massively Multiplayer Online gaming communities such as World of Warcraft. Successful MMORPGs are brilliantly DESIGNED for the player to be introduced to each social mechanic incrementally. These games feed social mechanics to the player in baby steps, giving time for players to feel comfortable with each introduced mechanic, whether it is utilizing the auction house, forming ad hoc groups to finish quests, or simply being able to wave hello in the game. It is after some time that players naturally come to the conclusion that they have more FUN when utilizing the social mechanic. As connections with the game and the community are formed, the game offers extra social mechanics to help with maintaining these new relationships, and the player becomes more and more invested in the community. 

Unfortunately, Yelp isn't a fantastical world filled with orcs and elves (as far as I know), so there's no roleplaying to be done here. However, the core concepts are still similar. Social platforms can be designed to encourage social concepts for a user to be more and more invested in the community. 

If a user isn't comfortable writing a review just yet, could something be done to have the user warm up to the idea after some time? Is there something for the user to take value out of until then? Can users play the Yelp game "solo" until they feel comfortable saying hi to the people sitting next to them?

Let's get to it. Let's see what we can do.

Meet Basic Bob
==============

For this journey, let's take Basic Bob. We'll follow Bob through his thought process and see what it takes for him to be engaged.

Basic Bob here is a typical lurker of Yelp. He already uses Yelp; he knows what it is and what it does, and he uses it to search for restaurants when he's hungry and wants/needs something to Instagram (#foodie). 

Basic Bob has written 0 reviews, and checked-in to maybe 5 or 6 places (he wanted that free appetizer!). He admittedly only created an account just to use the mobile app. He's not even sure if he's logged in to the desktop app. 

Now, without the proper numbers, I'm going to say that this is the vast majority of the users; this should be the 90% according to the 1% rule. 

Let's see what Bob thinks about the Yelp community. He knows that Yelp's content is based off of user reviews and star ratings, but he doesn't want to spend the time to flex his creative muscles and write some colorful review for some reason or another. It may be that he's lazy, or that he doesn't feel like throwing his review in the ocean of the other hundred existing ones.  It doesn't really matter. He's never reacted to any reviews because he just doesn't want to be involved yet.

This is the first social challenge that should be addressed.  How do we get users to start contributing to their communities?  What is their perception of a community? 

To get in the mind of Bob, it will help to understand how [users tend to read on the web](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-users-read-on-the-web/). 

As taken from the linked site: 

Most users simply scan pages for **scannable text**, using

* highlighted **keywords** (hypertext links serve as one form of highlighting; typeface variations and color are others)
* meaningful **sub-headings** (not "clever" ones)
* bulleted **lists**
* **one idea** per paragraph (users will skip over any additional ideas if they are not caught by the first few words in the paragraph)

Okay?

Now let's take a look at Yelp's homepage again.


Welcome! now get to work
========================

<div class="row uniform">

<p></p>

The only call to action that Bob sees is Yelp wanting him to search and... to write a review.  And Bob doesn't want to.  Bob thinks to himself, "Have I even been to Whitechapel?"

So now what? Now that Bob is logged in... shouldn't there be something for him to do that benefits him?

As it is now, the psychological subconscious experience with creating an account is sort of like being presented with a virtual pen and paper, and announcing to the user: *Hey! Welcome! Write a review for Yelp!* 

Remember, users are inherently selfish, and an app must fight for a user's attention. The call to immediatly write a review appeals to anyone who finds the idea of being heard by the world fascinating, but chances are, those people are already reviewing. 

**Once logged in, there's no additional value added to the user.**  

The layout of features are almost self-serving to Yelp at the moment. The focus is on Yelp and contributing to Yelp. Review this page to add it to the other Yelp reviews to add it to the PUBLIC page. Add a photo to this restaurant for others to see.  Help Yelp out by providing more information to Yelp. Help Yelp build the database.

Bob doesn't want to help Yelp yet. Bob wants the equivalent of a free t-shirt for signing up. He was just curious.  He wants to be rewarded for giving Yelp his e-mail address.  He wants something that benefits HIM.  

So what's the easiest adjustment that can be made for any user that creates an account? 

Personalization. 

Me, myself, and I: The new social network
=========================================

Social networking has evolved over the last decade. The once-celebrated broad networks interconnecting everyone and everything is no longer the trend. "The Internet of Me" is the new expectation. 

> “A squirrel dying in your front yard may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa.” -Mark Zuckerberg

Showing a user what is relevant to them is important now more than ever. Consumers have more control, now that there's more competition in every industry. Businesses are fighting to deliver the best experience to earn the coveted loyalty that users can bring. 

More and more, users are taking these services for granted, thinking "what's in it for me" when clicking around. As soon as they find a better tool that treats them better, they're gone. 

Maybe your own search habits reflect this. Think of all the times you cross-reference purchases with multiple online vendors for the lowest price. Think of the times you copy an address into Google Maps even though another map might be already in front of you. Convenience is the new language. 

Brand loyalty is completely correlated with how well the brand treats the user. For every new service, there is surely a competitor fighting for the same customer.

Bob's Yelp
==========

So let's get back to how we can look at Yelp's page. The ultimate goal is to get Bob reviewing, but he's reluctant. 

So let's give something back to Bob first, and make Yelp about him, and show him what he wants to see. 

Remember the activity chart form the last post? Let's see who each activity "benefits" at its core.

| **Activity** | **Benefits** |
| --- | :-: |
| Search for restaurant/business, read reviews. | Bob |
| Call business through Yelp. | Bob |
| Find directions to business through Yelp. | Bob |
| View an event | Bob |
| Log in |  |
| Save a bookmark | Bob |
| React to (like, compliment) a review | Yelp |
| Modify restaurant information | Yelp |
| Start a "Conversation" | Yelp/Bob |
| Share a photo | Yelp |
| Write a review | Yelp |


But let's take a look at a small tweak. A small perspective switch.  Let's make this about Bob, and not about giving back to Yelp.

Remember how I mentioned Bob was reluctant to even react to a review? Let's see if there's a way to first provide Bob some value through reacting.  

What if there was a way for Bob to save a nugget of information that he read about in a review that he liked, and to be able to collect and persist that info on the restaurant's page.  With the act of Bob saving a review, or maybe highlighting an excerpt of a review for his own reasons (a dish he wants to try, things to avoid, best seats in the house), Bob is personalizing that restaurant's page for HIS own viewing, creating a restaurant "cheat sheet" for when he decides to try the restaurant. 

And what else does this do? This gives Bob a reason to go back to the restaurant's page, *specifically the page on Yelp (and not Google) due to Bob's personalized notes*. Feedback can still be given back to the original writer of the review, saying that the review has been "clipped" by x number of people. 

Now, obviously this is just one feature suggestion, and there are plenty of ways to design that one feature, but hopefully the motivation behind it is clear. 

Give Bob more of a reason to interact. Give Bob a reason to use Yelp the way he wants to.

Improve the process of bookmarking restaurants to bookmarks. Bring My Reviews and My Bookmarks to the main navigation bar.  

Emphasize that it became Bob's Yelp the moment he logged in. 

Present recently searched/viewed restaurants on the homepage. Gently remind Bob where he's been or what he has searched for, just in case he's asking himself "wait what was that one restaurant I looked for recently?"

Allow Bob to check-in privately. Perhaps re-labeling "check-in" can lower the social difficulty curve.  The ability to make a self-note that he had eaten there before could be enough.  Assure Bob that the data will be shared only with people only if he wants it to be. 

Let Bob write tips and reviews for himself. 

Frame it in a way that convinces Bob that he's doing this for himself first, for his own personal food diary. 

Let Bob keep a tally of his own favorite restaurants. Let Bob sort his favorite restaurants into groups. Show some popular restaurants that people in his selected network have been going to. Maybe even let Bob share his list of curated favorite restaurants with a few friends. 

Instead of focusing on a specific review, highlight the restaurants that are abuzz in his network. 

Let Bob settle in with the Yelp platform.  

| Note: As I'm writing this, it occurs to me that there are probably contractual obligations and complications where Yelp cannot be seen promoting restaurants over others, which may explain why there's such a heavy-focus on presenting reviews over anything else.

Let Bob continue to lurk, to stand on the side of the room and watch his community work. And let him react to it for his own amusement.  The goal is to have Bob conclude that the experience might improve with interaction.  After "playing the Yelp game" solo, maybe present the idea of "playing" the Yelp game with a small group.  Expand his Yelp world from his world of one to a world of his actual friends (among his facebook friends).  

This way, when Bob writes something, he's not writing for Yelp, he's writing for himself... or maybe a smaller group of people he's comfortable with.  The goal is to grow Bob's world incrementally, to convince him that the more engaged he CHOOSES to be, the more value he gains himself. 

The emphasis must be on what Bob experiences. To be thrust into a community of reviewers and told to write for the world is scary. No one wants to compete with the self-proclaimed Anton Ego's of the world, and no one wants to shout into an empty room.

The initial challenge is to simply get the snowball rolling.  

I have no doubt that after a certain point, Yelp has a handle on keeping quality reviewers continually engaged. The challenge is simply getting more users to become quality contributors.

So now what?
============

Now I show this to a designer. 

No seriously, I'm terrible at designing. 

ugh
===



There are plenty of changes that can be made, but we should at least try to identify what's a higher priority. 

We can treat the journey to writing a review as a funnel, and track to see where the biggest dropoff is. It wouldn't be a funnel that would be completed in a single session, but over significant time, so we can just look at numbers. 

Right now we have datapoints for number of Yelp users registered. We can also find number of Yelp users that have written at least 5 reviews in the last month (engaged users). 

To understand the dropoff, whatever it may be, we can begin introducing intermediate "steps" for a user to take on the path to Engaged User. 

If we break down activities into network sizes: Self, Immediate Network, Community Network, Public Network, we might be able to identify where the deficiency is.

This could be utilizing bookmarks, checking in, writing tips, uploading photos, reacting to reviews. Look for trends, look to convert as many as possible. 

Remember, people aren't dropping off from writing reviews because they don't know how. At this point in Yelp's maturity, it's most likely because they simply don't want to.








What's an easy approach to solving this problem? 

Well for Yelp's case, let's assume that the end goal is for a lurker to become an active reviewer, and let's define an active reviewer as a user that writes at least one review a month. 

We can calculate conversion rates based off this, by parsing through available data. 

Drawing up a funnel chart would be a good visualization for a task like this, with users with an account at the top, and users that have more than x reviews in the past 3 months at the bottom. 

Now, the more elements we have in the middle, the more insight we gain.
