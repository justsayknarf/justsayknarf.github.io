**A plan is not a strategy.**
**A business plan is not a product vision.**

A plan is a tactic. The why behind the plan should speak to the strategy.

Plans should be malleable at the tactical level. Strategies should be malleable at the management/leadership level.

Feeling like a plan cannot be changed can lead to apathy, valid opinions being silenced.

Opinions move things forward. Lack of opinion can lead to can kicking.

It's important not to *force* an opinion onto someone, but, when necessary, present opinions to guide conversations. They don't need to be original opinions, and, in fact, oftentimes they are not. If anything, they are often the opinions of those that are not in the room. If the product manager is *constantly* deferring to the loudest person in the room, and is forced to be a professional soothsayer in expensive meetings, revisit the strategy.

Lack of opinion can be a signal of strategic misalignment, and itâ€™s important to identify it and address it as soon as possible.
