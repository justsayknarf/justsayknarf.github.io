So I recently came across a rant about Pokemon Go that was posted on Facebook. After spending such a long time writing down my thoughts celebrating the game in the last post, it made me want to respond directly to his rant. How could he hate on the actualization of such a cherished brand? I refrained from unleashing digital wrath (re: LOL how could you??), and I reread the post.  While I realize the wording was largely negative (haters gonna hate), I realized that for all the points that he laid out as to why the game was bad, he wasn't... wrong.

Pokemon Go is, in its current state, objectively NOT a fully-designed game. Is this bad?

The current design
==================

By now, now that we've all had time to continually play this game, you've either experienced this by asking yourself this, or you've asked a Pokemon Go-er that you know: "Wait what's the point? Why am I doing this?"

And the answer right now is pretty obvious: "I want to be the very best - that no one ever was" (*runs away fist-pumping to the Pokemon theme song*) 

<span class="image left image-caption"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/I1CLbBW.gif"></span>

Yes, the primary driving force right now for a player to play the game is to be the owner of all 150 (original) Pokemon in the digital/real world, to have all 150 Pokemon grace your phone with its presence, and allow itself to be caught by your superior Pokeball throwing (up-swiping) skills. You want to catch them all, and each random Pokemon encounter is another chance to fill in those empty Pokedex entries. 

You then spend hard-earned Pokemon candies and stardust to increase its Combat Power to use these Pokemon to take control of gyms. 

Simple enough.

But wait. On top of the technical server issues, players have reported that the Combat Power (CP) scaling of a Pokemon is completely broken, water type Pokemon being completely overpowered, and gym battles are a complete joke with no strategy involved at all.  And on top of that, the ONLY way to even gain more candies and stardust is to catch... more Pokemon. Players are starting to wonder if there's anything more to this game.

How much longer will this game last?

Skinner Box Mechanics: Mobile Games and Operant Conditioning
==================================================

As a quick aside, let's first take a look at the Skinner Box.

I have [Extra Credits to thank for articulating so many of my thoughts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWtvrPTbQ_c) so well, and pointing me in the right direction again in my research. 

The Skinner box is named after B.F. Skinner, a man studying psychology with theories that would become the foundation of behaviorialism. It had already been discovered that animals could be trained to condition reactions via classical conditioning (Pavlov's dog and the bell), but Skinner went a couple steps further, experimenting with the theory that people can be condition the way people make choices. 

Skinner considered free will an illusion and human action dependent on consequences of previous actions. If the consequences are bad, there is a high chance the action will not be repeated; if the consequences are good, the actions that led to it being repeated become more probable. Skinner called this the principle of reinforcement.  You've probably heard of positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement; you have Skinner here to thank. 

The Skinner box was a device that he had created to test his now-known theory. The box was simple: it had a button or a lever, that when pressed, could trigger a reward (food) or a punishment (small electric shock).  In this box, he would put test subjects (rats, birds), and record how often birds would peck at the button provided, with how much force, how long it would take to "learn" the behavior, and how long it would take to "forget" it.

<span class="image right image-caption"><img src="http://rationalwiki.org/w/images/thumb/5/59/Skinner_box.jpg/200px-Skinner_box.jpg">Halp.</span>

Simply put, a pigeon would be put in a box with a button. The pigeon pecks the button. Food falls out. Skinner nods and scribbles some notes.

Now, what makes this interesting are the variations of conditioning that he experimented with. He would try rewarding the behavior every time, try punishing other behaviors, try removing the reward, etc.  

Skinner found that with continuous reinforcement (pigeon is rewarded EVERY time at first, and then completely cut off), pigeons would have a very LOW response rate to the button, and the pigeon would GIVE UP incredibly quickly once the reward stopped coming. 

Skinner continued to experiment with different timings of rewards: rewarding one every five tries, one every 5 min (as long as there was at least one correct response), etc., and he would record the response rate (how hard the subject tried), and the extinction rate (how long it would take for the subject to give up) of the behavior. 

So he goes through all these experiments, and one variation has the pigeons and rats pecking and pulling levers like crazy (relatively), for what seems like an eternity (in rat and pigeon time).  This variation was Variable Interval Reinforcement, where rewards were given after an unpredictable amount of time has passed. This is what you want if you're trying to teach behavior. A fast response rate, with a low extinction rate. 

This is operant conditioning at its best. Rewarding subjects for doing a relatively mindless action and convincing them that the reward is worth it. This is what games are based on, and this is what keeps people playing one.

Actually, there is one more variation that has the pigeons pecking with the force of a troupe of tap dancers, for longer than even the Variable Interval Reinforcement.  These pigeons are pecking harder than they've never pecked before in other experiments. They love pecking. They aren't giving up.  

Which reward schedule was that? The variation where the actions are rewarded after a RANDOM number of times. 

Sound familiar? It should. What do you think slot machines are?

Skinner box mechanics are game mechanics that condition user playtime with some sort of reward schedule. RPGs are known for this, each battle providing XP to level up your character. 

So here's the thing.  All games rely on some sort of reward system to keep a player engaged.  This is not the worst thing in the world. Players should always feel some sense of reward for playing the game, in some shape or form; otherwise, why play the game at all.  A game shouldn't feel like a chore.

Mobile games, while simple, tend to have one or two elements that keep players engaged. They are almost always a fairly simple game mechanic tacked with some sort of reward schedule, conditioning players to feel like they're engaged with the game. Again, simple doesn't necessarily mean bad.  Simple mechanics can still make a good game.  Take a look popular mobile games of recent past.  Bejeweled, Flappy Bird, Temple Run.  Trying to earn a new high score is a mechanic that's been used for years. World of Warcraft uses the same rewards system in the form of random loot drops.  Even Solitaire is a good example. The infrequent wins of a Solitaire game are enough to keep the player playing. 

<span class="image left image-caption"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wfwb0ty02fA/Ut4BtM5tglI/AAAAAAAAABg/bNwI6aQ__sY/s1600/solitaire.gif">Ahhhhhh that feels good.</span> Don't tell me that you don't get that warm fuzzy feeling when you see those cards bounce away in victory.

These reward systems aren't bad. What I'm arguing IS bad is when a scheduled reward system is used to MASK the shortcomings of poorly designed game mechanics.  Players being rewarded for doing something mindnumbingly droll, i.e. mashing a button, pulling a lever... hm. 

THIS is what will determine the lifespan of a game.  Games of these types are the type of games that you keep playing far past the "fun" stage, where after you sink hours into, you look back and wonder "Why the hell did I spend so much time playing that?" 

Still wondering what I mean? Go play [Cookie Clicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) for awhile and get back to me.

If the game mechanic is fairly boring, the novelty keeps the player engaged for a period of time, and discovery element with the reward schedule will keep the player engaged for a bit longer.  

Once people start questioning the conditioned behavior and whether it's worth the reward, the game needs more and more to keep that player engaged. 

So for Pokemon Go, amidst all the technical issues, frustration is already building, and the novelty of the reward is already wearing off. But didn't the game just come out? What's happening? Why does it ALREADY feel like a grind?


Discovery + Novelty
===================

Pokemon Go's engagement is almost completely reliant on the player's penchant for DISCOVERY.  There is discovery in physically going to new locations in hopes of discovering different Pokemon spawn locations, discovery in tracking down Pokemon, discovery in what Pokemon is hatching out of that egg the player just walked 5km for.

And the game does this part amazingly. This is the reason why the game went viral. This is the reason so many people are playing the game, and the reason for my last post. People are eager to find what's out there in their city, eager to do some exploring with their friends. 

Unfortunately, I don't think the game developers were prepared for just how rabid the player base would be.  Players immediately began creating maps and spawn locations of Pokemon, crowdsourcing information from all over the country in hopes of discovering the rules of the randomness.  The game's mysteries were being uncovered by hardcore players, and immediately made available to EVERYONE, thanks to the internet. 

And there's not much depth to what there is to truly DISCOVER. The mechanic is relatively simple. Different areas have a tendency to spawn different Pokemon. If you want to fill your Pokedex, you'll have to go to different areas, with no guarantee of success.

It's hard to keep things new. It's hard to keep the mystery alive.  A game may go viral due to some incredibly cool novelty mechanic, but a GOOD game will keep the player engaged with so much more once the novelty wears off. 

So how can else can a game keep a player engaged? 

Expert Pokeball Thrower - Mastery 
================================

Let's take a look at the idea of mastery. A good game gives players the opportunity to master a skill, and then utilize that mastery for rewards. Think Rock Band, Street Fighter, ...Flappy Bird, even. 
<span class="image right"><img src="http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/technology/gaming/2014/02/140210_GAME_FlappyBirdGameOver.jpg">
</span>

Pokemon Go's only form of mastery lies in the capturing of Pokemon via Pokeball throw, and the sad excuse that currently is the Gym Battle.  Those two game mechanics are the only parts of the game that require specific variable user input that has a direct effect on the outcome. If the user does not swipe a certain way, the ball will never be thrown to hit the Pokemon. If the player never taps during a battle, the player's Pokemon will lose to his/her opponent.

But the biggest problem right now, is that it's questionable if either of those CAN be mastered through the technical issues.  Curve balls are rarely registered when they actually curve, and curve ball rewards are granted when the player isn't even trying. Maybe players have yet to discover how exactly to use Razz Berries in the "strategy" of capturing a Pokemon, but technical issues cause any sort of experimentation to be impossible. If a game seems to have an arbitrary set of rewards for technical MASTERY, the game presents nothing to truly... master and becomes, well, bullshit. 

Imagine if you played a piano, and even though you're hitting the keys perfectly, the piano misses notes at random. Imagine how infuriating that'd be if you were trying to learn a certain piece of music that you've never heard before, unsure if you're ever actually playing the right notes.  That's not a piano you would play. Technical mastery requires a strict set of rules that the player understands to be true, so the player knows how to correct behavior.  When a player pushes the jump button, the character should jump EVERY TIME. If the same line is drawn to throw a Pokeball, the Pokeball should land in the same place every time.  If the ball is spinning and the Pokemon is ultimately caught, the Curve Ball bonus should be granted every time. 

Players already know that Pokemon don't have a 100% rate of capture even if the Pokeball hits, but without a set of rules to dictate how to maximize the rate, players feel like they have no control on the outcome, and the engagement is lost. 

With all the technical issues, the game is beginning to feel more and more like a slot machine, except with more and more effort to even pull the lever. 

For now, players will continue to blame the servers, but the clock is ticking for Niantic and Nintendo. 

What's the story, Wishbone? - Narrative
=======================================

Narrative provides a reason for players to pick up a controller and play a game. Some games' narratives are so immersive, the player immediately gets sucked into the world, and continues to play just to feel part of it. Others are relatively simple.

Most mobile games don't need fully established narratives. You don't necessarily need a reason why these jewels need to be matched in 3s to make them disappear.  You don't necessarily NEED a reason why this bird is flapping through these pipes. But most games try to provide just enough context to make the game intersting anyway. 

I mean, take a look at this story trailer of [Jetpack Joyride](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jzxi8nid9BQ). 

Story context or not, these games always provide a REASON to try and get the high score. Each time you die or finish a round, you SEE what your personal best is. You can see the high scores of people in your network, and you can see the high scores in the global leaderboards as well.  If you want to be recognized for your achievement, you better keep practicing. 

Pokemon Go's main motivation to "catch them all" is never encouraged by the game itself. It's pretty much the only thing to do (besides take pictures with them), without even the weakest of stories to provide a reason why. There is practically NO narrative behind any of it. 

Pokemon Go has seemingly forgotten about this aspect, or has assumed that the lore of Pokemon was enough to drive all gameplay. After your introduction to the professor, the professor is never seen again. After your arbitrary team allegiance, those team leaders ARE NEVER SEEN AGAIN (what were their names again?).

Who are these guys?
</div>
</div>

The lack of narrative was fine when everything about the game was new, but many players are now reaching a stage in the game where they need to simply grind for more Pokemon. 

In most games, the grind is understood, the need to get stronger is reinforced by the story, by the next huge challenge ahead. This isn't true in Pokemon Go.  The only other characters of the game are the other Pokemon Go players. But why are YOU, as a player, catching these Pokemon? Why are YOU taking over these gyms? How can you even tell if you're the very best (that no one ever was)? 

While at first I praised how the design of the game promoted some incredible new social dynamics in the real world, I'm starting to seriously think that Niantic was extremely lucky that the players themselves created a desperately needed narrative for themselves. 

<span class="image right"><img src="http://www.mindtheproduct.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/narrative.jpg"></span>Luckily, narrative is relatively easy to fix. It's a simple matter of presenting some simple information at key moments in the game.

If turf wars are to be encouraged, players only need to be reminded that the turf war exists.  Presenting a history of ownership in a gym can be a huge encouragement to fight or train at a gym. If you take down a gym, your name is etched in the RECORDS that you, Trainer192385, tore down the dirty Team Valor gym in the name of Team Instinct (only to have it taken back instantly).  Presenting players with a global Team leaderboard, breaking down Gym Ownership by teams across by nation, by state, by region. Have the Team Leaders (the cool characters that tried to recruit you in the team selection screen) come back and say a few words of encouragement when you take down a certain number of gyms.  Give players the RECOGNITION for the actions they are taking.

If Pokedex completion should be encouraged, give gentle reminders of how close they are to finishing their Pokedex.  Don't make it arbitrarily more difficult to catch low CP Pokemon.  Don't arbitrarily punish players for doing what was always easy.  

It's a FIRE SALE
================

![thisisfine](http://i.imgur.com/c4jt321.png)

Niantic and Nintendo are fighting technical fires while seemingly lighting new ones before the first ones are even put out. Even as the servers are overloaded, other parts of the game continue to crash and glitch, and bugs continue to be reported.

Pokemon Go has a limited lifespan now. The technical issues of the game are severly impacting the gameplay at its core, and as players are routinely PUNISHED for playing the game correctly, each player's motivation to play the game is negatively impacted. Eventually, people WILL lose interest, and even the appeal of new Pokemon might not be enough to capture the audience's interest.

I have faith, though. I don't think Pokemon Go will ultimately fail.  I feel like I'll continually to monitor any news, to see if there have been any legendary bird sightings, any signs of Mew or Mewtwo.  

I just think that Pokemon Go has a TON of potential, and I just really want the game to live up to it. 

The clock is ticking, Niantic. 

On the other hand... Some afterthoughts
=======================================
Niantic holds data that I clearly don't see.  Most of my analysis comes from approaching Pokemon Go as a game, so all my data comes from gaming design in the traditional sense. 

Perhaps Pokemon Go is a new style of game that Niantic is trying to pioneer. Perhaps Pokemon Go is trying to be the first digital geocaching-type application, and doesn't quite qualify as a game in that sense. 

It's quite possible that Google found out that people continued to look for all 150 Pokemon during the Google Maps April Fools game wayyyy longer than anyone predicted, and they KNEW that the brand itself had staying power beyond anyone else's imagination, and the decision to launch the game in its current state was completely strategical. 

I may never know. 

All I do know is that I'm still going to fire my app back up at my spot at the gym where 2 PokeStops overlap, and I'm definitely still going to stay tuned to any Pokemon events waiting to be revealed.  

I still wanna be the very best, I guess.
