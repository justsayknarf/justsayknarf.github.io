I grew up as an engineer. Growing up, I was surrounded by books, rules, guidelines, and structure. I built what I knew based off of what was shown to me as correct. I wasn't the type to explore the abstract possibilities of these things.  Provided what I was taught was from a source that I respected, it was the best way to do it. 

I didn't appreciate good design back then. If something was "hard to use" I would find a way to use it until it wasn't hard to use. If there was a repetitive task to be done, I would find the most efficient way to do it, and execute without wasting any time. Those were challenges that I embraced. 

And I never considered that everything that was in front of me HAD been designed by someone, or a team of someones. Objects weren't designed to elicit emotion. They were obviously there to execute its function. To me, at the time, if people were frustrated using something... they just weren't trying hard enough. 

Things are obviously much much different now.

Nowadays, I find myself touching the surfaces of everything, admiring the texture, the color, the angles of whatever it is I'm using, mentally raising a glass with a subtle headnod to its designers. 

I become hyper-aware of my blood pressure challenging me to keep my temper when I'm staring at an incredibly poorly designed interface. 

I've become a harsh critic based off of my sensitive emotional responses, and yet I feel completely lost when it comes to being on the creative side of it all. 

With my appreciation for good design comes a profound respect for the people creating it. As I sit staring at my empty canvas of a website ("borrowing" from gorgeous free template resources), it amazes me how difficult it is to be a good "creator," and how much MORE difficult it is to be a great one. 

Take photography for example.  To me, it is easier now, more than ever, to shoot a photograph that is visually appealing, and I mean this in the most moderate sense of the word. You take a picture with your phone (which is an amazing camera), you crop it, throw some filters on it, and there you have a picture that evokes some sort of emotion. You're not sure what emotion, but it is AN emotion. It gets posted to social media, and the hearts/likes come flooding in. (Or they don't. Social media is a game after all.) But it's easy to be mediocre. 

For me, when I know the stuff I'm doing isn't great, I try to share it somewhere anyway now. It's the process that matters now, as long as you are practicing deliberately. As long as you are not sharing it for the sake of sharing. You know if you are practicing for the sake of improving, so it's important that you don't compare yourself to others for it. 

There is no rulebook out there to what is good and what isn't. I actually feel like my work is too derivitive, BECAUSE I try to follow these "good design" guidelines too often. But that's okay. 

I'll continue to study what it is I like about the things I like, and hopefully my own rulebook will come out of it.

>“Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.”
