> grind <br>
- To rub or cause to rub together gratingly. <br>
- move noisily and laboriously, especially against a countering force. <br>

What is it about games and grinding?  Why do we do it? Why do we like to do it? DO we even LIKE doing it? What makes one grind in a game, when, in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't matter? 

It's a common aspect of games now, with the rise of mobile games, and it's something that really should be understood when designing a game or teaching a new skill.

What is a grind?
=======

When it comes to video games the grind is most commonly correlated with the idea of character progression. A mundane repetetive task to be executed over and over in order to gain something in return.  In RPGs, it often involves killing the same enemies over and over in a same location in order to gain experience, progressing the character, and not the story. It might be repeatedly mashing A on the gamepad, or repeatedly clicking, staring at the screen, watching the XP bar gradually increase, until the bar fills up completely, and an arbitrary number increases by 1, telling the player it was all worth it.

And then you do it all again. 

It's such a staple (and almost required) in games nowadays, that designers are allowed to include the grind because it is understood to be a necessary part of a game.  However, if done poorly, the grind is nothing but lazy.  It's a poor means for a game designer to unnaturally extend the length of his/her game, and the game's overall quality suffers for it. 

But it obviously doesn't have to be this way. 

So let's take a look at why people are willing to do this "meaningless" task in the first place, and how they can be done well, and how some games fail. 

Why?
====

To understand why people grind in the first place, it might be worth understanding why people enjoy playing games at all. 

Games are inherently an escape, a form of entertainment.  Video games are a way for a player to experience a new world with a new set of rules, a challenge for players to solve in a format that books and movies cannot provide. The player is invested in that way, as it elicits the feeling that the player's choices will affect the outcome. The feeling of finishing a game is akin to completing a puzzle, finishing a book, finishing a movie, with different levels of immersion, interaction, and involvement.

No matter what you're going through, no matter how hard your life is, playing a game a little more guarantees forward progress, in the form of knowledge, story, or mastery.  That's psychologically *satisfying*.

It's not pointless repetition.  It's a clear and identifiable PERCEIVED PROGRESS toward a goal that compells a player to grind.  

If the grind itself isn't fun, the next short term reward should be enough to balance out repetition. To understand how they should work together, it's worth looking at them separately.

Short Term Rewards
======
Games relying completely on short term rewards exploit a person's vulnerability towards addiction. (see Skinner Box related discussions)

At its most extreme case and morally questionable, look at slot machines. 

The player repeats a mundane task over and over, bombarded with lights and sounds and spinning visual cues, and the CHANCE to reap reward.  And when you do win, golly does it feel good. 

There is no long term narrative that keeps the player going back to the same slot machine.  The only narrative is: "Just one more pull. Maybe the next one will be the one where I double my money." The action potential for one more is low.  The investment is low.  The chance for reward, in the mind of the player, is high, because the anticipation alone is a positive experience.  


Long Term Rewards
======
Things that rely heavily on the long term reward test a person's grit, or the ability to persist through hardships towards a bigger payoff in the end. 

An example that come to mind is literally training for a marathon. The mundane task of running... for 26.2 miles, with... not much to show (in terms of reward).  All rewa

Training for a marathon requires drive, grit, determination. The goal itself needs to mark all the checkboxes in order to push you to action. Think of all the people you know that go on 26 mile runs just for fun.  Think of all the people that announce they need to start training because they just signed up for a marathon. 

The action potential to train for a marathon is high. It often requires a monetary deposit ("Well, I paid this much money to register, I have to do this now."), getting off the couch, going through regimented training schedules, etc.

You do the same action over and over, getting better at it each time, until you're ready to run the entire thing.

The run is a grind. 

Finishing is the long term reward.

Why is this important in games? When SHOULD games have grinds?
=====

If you want to ensure the player has a certain level of mastery, introducing a soft barrier before allowing the player to proceed forces the player to stop and grind before proceeding. This could be in the form of an actual level requirement (you must be at least Level 10 to enter this room), item requirement (you must collect 10 more gems), or required enemy encounters (super strong enemies). 

For multiplayer games, it helps ensure a level playing field. People with certain levels have understandably put in a specific amount of time to get to that level, which can somewhat guarantee a certain degree in skill and mechanics of the game.

Arguably all games have grinds. It's a matter of presentation and having enough game content where the grind is not used as an artificial filler to extend gameplay. 

In fact, there are some games that are COMPLETELY built around this progression grind.

SHOULD games have grinds?
======

Games don't NEED grinds. Grinds should be introduced for a REASON. 

For the grind to be enjoyable, designers must understand what type of game they are designing, who the players are, and how short-term goals and long-term goals should be identified and defined accordingly. 

Understanding when a grind should and should not be used is key.

Sim-type games may not require any "grind" as the game's core is mastery of the simulation at hand. The gameplay itself is a "grind" in a sense, and it is the process of learning and exploration that is enjoyed. See: Kerbal Space Program, Sim City.  

Narrative and interactive story-telling games do not have "grinds" because these games are simple mediums for the game designers to immerse the player in a new world to tell a story. See: Telltale-style games, Life is Strange, Heavy Rain.

Again, grinds are NOT replacements for game content. 

Grinds should be treated as OPPORTUNITIES to hone behaviors and masteries. 

Let's say you need to finish a quest that requires you to kill 10 of the same damn monster over and over.  Before, you could be every monster by just mashing attack over and over. But these mutated flies, or whatever, these mutated flies are HARDER.  They require you to activate at least 2 of your new skills in order to beat a few of them. 

THIS is the opportunity to hone behaviors. By the time you finish that quest, the game has basically taught you how to use skills. 

Think about the endgame in MMORPGs like World of Warcraft. By the time you reach the level cap, you aren't truly grinding for the best loot. Better loot isn't even guaranteed.  The teamwork, the relationships you've built, the mastery of the role you fill, the adventure of the raid itself is what you "grind" for. The gameplay itself is what keeps the player playing.  The loot is just a way of the game telling the players that the behavior is encouraged.



Back to Pokemon Go... again
====

Pokemon Go is unfortunately the reason that prompted me to do some thinking and research and write this post. Niantic adopted the gameplay of Ingress and tried to slap a new Pokemon theme on top of it, and it shows. The design from a full game experience is incredibly lacking.

The biggest complaint I have with gameplay was the lack of a REASON or ANY hint of narrative to encourage the gameplay. 

The ENTIRE game is a grind, and it's obvious as soon as the player understands the mechanics of the game. 

The main motivating long term goal is to catch all the Pokemon. However, it's widely known that this is literally impossible to do, given that several are region-locked, and other have simply not been released.  Nowhere in the game is this long-term goal even encouraged beyond the "# caught / 150 " display in one part of the game. 

The act of catching a Pokemon is a physical grind as well, with little to no reward for repeating the same, mundane action. The "random" element of whether a Pokemon stays in the ball or not is NOT a reward if it stays caught, but a perceived random PUNISHMENT for doing the correct action. 

I think Niantic banked on the idea that exploring the outside world would be compelling enough to go through the grind, which is completely valid. However, as game design goes, games must actively reward players for doing so, and suggest that the behavior is encouraged for more reasons than one.

I reiterate though: Pokemon Go is not a terrible game. It's a great concept. I simply feel that if they had the time to delay their release just a little bit, they could've gotten a game consultant type to wrap a small narrative around the existing game, and give a better reason to support the perceived grind of the game. 

It's not that they don't know how to design a game.  Standard game mechanics are clearly there. It's just that the way it's currently designed, only the hardcore will continue to grind.  And that's a shame, because this game had the potential of keeping even the most casual fans occupied for years.
