I currently live in San Francisco, one of the most diverse cities, and a city that celebrates its food offerings and California-fusion, farm-to-table, organic, free-range, vegan, hidden-gem restaurants.

There are SO many restaurants out there, and Yelp is my go-to app to find out what to eat. But, being a user for however many years I've been using it, I still find... SOMETHING clunky about it.  It does what it needs to do, but something seems a bit dated, and I wanted to think WHY it did. 

It's easy to point out things that could use an update, but I wanted the challenge to see if I could explain to myself what needed change.

So here we go.

Quick Statistics on Yelp
========================
Monthly desktop unique visitors: **77 million**  
Monthly mobile web unique visitors: **69 million**  
Monthly mobile app unique users: **21 million**  
**70%** of searches on Yelp that came from mobile devices across the globe.  
**58+%** of Yelp content (reviews and photos) was generated on the Yelp app.  ([source](https://www.yelp.com/factsheet))

Yelp app users were more than **10 times as engaged** as website users based on number of pages viewed.  ([source](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/yelp-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2015-financial-results-300216659.html))

From these numbers, it does look like Yelp is focusing a lot of mobile right now. But the curious thing is the trend of these graphs.

Take a look at the last graph in particular. Now I don't have the exact numbers, but it looks like desktop usage seems to be running flat. This is curious to me; SOMEONE should still be manning the helm of the desktop application, but given the lack of updates to the Yelp layout, it's possible that Yelp is almost ignoring the web app. While the numbers do show mobile as trending, it doesn't explain to me why that is.  

Now you can argue that users simply find it more useful to be using it on mobile over desktop. People are out and about, and need to find something near them; they pull out their phones, look things up.  That makes sense. But it doesn't explain the DROP in users in the last two years. 

Perhaps there are simply more mobile/tablet devices now in households, or people simply can't be bothered to use their desktop if they are more than 5 feet away from it.

I'm not sure I completely buy that argument though.  I think there are ways to drive more desktop users, but it's simply unclear to me what Yelp's current strategy with desktop is. 

The Yelp Social Network?
========================

Okay, so let's compare the landing pages for yelp.com, based on if we're logged in, and see what's going on. 

<div class="row uniform">
	<div class="6u">
	<span class="image fit"><img src="/images/yelp-home-in.JPG"></span> 
	</div>
	<div class="6u">
	<span class="image fit"><img src="/images/yelp-home-out.JPG"></span>
	</div>
</div>

<p></p>

Hm. 

The pages are fairly different between a logged-in user and a non-logged-in user.  I had never really noticed how different the homepage was until now, actually, but now I have a bunch of questions for these panels I'm presented with: Your Next Review, Recent Activity, Review of the Day, and Events. 

"Your Next Review" is up and center in a highlighted callout box. I've never written a review before, and I don't plan to. In fact, I'm not even sure where that specific coffeeshop is that it's prompting me to review. 

What is Review of the Day? How is this chosen? Why was it chosen? Also, why was the Review of the day a review from 02/22/2016?  

Why is Recent Activity of people I don't know? Oh okay, so it's a list of things that are "near me".  It simply feels like it's information about people I don't care about, because the main identifier is the user that added it, like my facebook feed. A feed full of people I don't know. 

I'm not much of a contributor of Yelp, so it's apparent that this homepage might not be tailored for people like me. I typically see Yelp as a restaurant/food search engine, and that's it. There's no social network aspect to this for me; that's what facebook/instagram/snapchat is for. 

![I'm going to get so many likes](https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-LH781_NYINST_P_20151117151507.jpg)

So what is Yelp trying to do with this page then?  I'm not entirely sure. It SEEMS like the primary action is for me to either search for a restaurant, or write a review... and that's it. And I don't want to write a review.  At least, not to post to Yelp for everyone to see. 

Okay okay, let's keep going.  After scrolling down...

Okay now I see "New Businesses in San Francisco" and "Best of Yelp: San Francisco". THIS is the first bit of relevant information to me, personally. I'm going to Yelp with the intent to find a restaurant by some means.  New Restaurants and Best Of lists are much more likely to influence my decision than my non-existent Yelp social network.  Granted, I'm going straight for the search bar anyway, so perhaps it doesn't matter ALL that much.

Annnnd. That's it. Wait why am I logged in. All I want to do is find a restaurant and nothing here helps me do that really. 

Okay. Stream of consciousness over. 

All in all, I'm not sure what Yelp wants me to do after I login. The vast majority of the information on the home page is new data I've never seen before, and, on top of that, I have no idea why I'm seeing it. 

All of this anecodotal evidence brings me to this claim:

**Yelp doesn't encourage users to explore the site for any other reason BUT to use it as a search engine.**

What does this mean?
====================

To me, it means an oversight on user engagement. If the goal is to keep the user engaged, there needs to be a reason why a user would be encouraged to create an account. Once created, the user should be immediately rewarded with all the benefits of being an account holder, and be reminded as such.  And, hopefully, the more engaged the user chooses to be, the more the user gets out of it.

There are phases for a user to be deeply engaged with a product, and the user needs to be provided value all along the way. If the barrier of entry is too high, then that value needs to be worth the effort, or the user won't bother. 

It's important to note first though: *Active users and engaged users are NOT the same thing.*

Engage
======
![engage](http://ecologyofeducation.net/wsite/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/picard-588x448.jpg)  

So what does it mean to engage a user? From app to app, it's up to the team to decide and optimize on. 

From [this post on knowtify.io](http://blog.knowtify.io/four-steps-for-creating-a-user-engagement-score/), 

> "What is an engaged customer of [our product]?"  
They should answer with something like, "An engaged user of [our product] does X, Y, Z."

So let's take a look at some potential Engagement Activities for Yelp:

* Search for restaurant/business, read reviews.
* Call business through Yelp. 
* Find directions to business through Yelp. 
* Log in
* Write a review
* Share a photo
* React to (like, compliment) a review
* View an event
* Save a bookmark
* Send a message
* Start a "Conversation"

Which one of these even need a user to be logged in? And, on another note, which one of these benefit from users creating the content? 

To be honest, I think Yelp has already done a great job in bringing in traffic from the normal users of the site; the ones that are just there to find the information they want and get out are successfully doing just that. 

If the an engaged user of Yelp only needs to successfully search for a business, call, and find directions, then perfect. We're done.

But this can't be the definition of an engaged user. Yelp's content is user-generated.  Yelp needs to engage the user to write reviews. 



According to the [1% rule of Internet Culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture)), 1% of the users of a website actively create new content, while 99% lurk. If Yelp is trying to foster a community, I hope that they meet at least 1%. Again I don't have the numbers, so I can't say if Yelp is actually succeeding or not, but I do think Yelp has a LOT it can improve on to really drive more user interaction with its casual users. 
 
With the [merit](http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2015/08/i-cant-stop-reading-these-one-star-yelp-reviews-national-parks) of a single Yelp review holding [less and less respect](http://insidescoopsf.sfgate.com/blog/2014/09/17/richmond-restaurant-owner-encourages-bad-yelp-reviews/), I think Yelp could stand to redesign some of its pages, and up the user engagement.
