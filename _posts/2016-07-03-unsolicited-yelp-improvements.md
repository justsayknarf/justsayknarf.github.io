I currently live in San Francisco, one of the most diverse cities, and a city that celebrates its food offerings and California-fusion, farm-to-table, organic, free-range, vegan, hidden-gem restaurants.

There are SO many restaurants out there, and Yelp is my go-to app to find out what to eat. But, being a user for however many years I've been using it, I still find... SOMETHING clunky about it.  It does what it needs to do, but something seems a bit dated, and I wanted to think WHY it did. 

It's easy to point out things that could use an update, but I wanted the challenge to see if I could explain to myself what needed change.

So here we go.

Quick Statistics on Yelp
========================
Monthly desktop unique visitors: **77 million**  
Monthly mobile web unique visitors: **69 million**  
Monthly mobile app unique users: **21 million**  
**70%** of searches on Yelp that came from mobile devices across the globe.  
**58+%** of Yelp content (reviews and photos) was generated on the Yelp app.  ([source](https://www.yelp.com/factsheet))

Yelp app users were more than **10 times as engaged** as website users based on number of pages viewed.  ([source](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/yelp-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2015-financial-results-300216659.html))

From these numbers, it does look like Yelp is focusing a lot of mobile right now. But the curious thing is the trend of these graphs. 

<span class="image fit">

</span>

Take a look at the last graph in particular. Now I don't have the exact numbers, but it looks like desktop usage seems to be running flat. This is curious to me; SOMEONE should still be manning the helm of the desktop application, but given the lack of updates to the Yelp layout, it's possible that Yelp is almost ignoring the web app. While the numbers do show mobile as trending, it doesn't explain to me why that is.  

Now you can argue that users simply find it more useful to be using it on mobile over desktop. People are out and about, and need to find something near them; they pull out their phones, look things up.  That makes sense. But it doesn't explain the DROP in users in the last two years. 

Perhaps there are simply more mobile/tablet devices now in households, or people simply can't be bothered to use their desktop if they are more than 5 feet away from it.  

![cantreach](http://www.laughtard.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/When-Im-lying-on-the-couch-and-cant-quite-reach-my-phone.gif)

I'm not sure I completely buy that argument though.  I think there are ways to drive more desktop users, but it's simply unclear to me what Yelp's current strategy with desktop is. 

The Yelp Social Network?
========================

Okay, so let's compare the landing pages for yelp.com, based on if we're logged in, and see what's going on. 

<div class="row uniform">
	<div class="6u">
	<span class="image fit"><img src="/images/yelp-home-in.JPG"></span> 
	</div>
	<div class="6u">
	<span class="image fit"><img src="/images/yelp-home-out.JPG"></span>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="row uniform">
	<div class="6u" style="text-align:center;">
	Logged In User
	</div>
	<div class="6u" style="text-align:center;">
	Normal User
	</div>
</div>
<p></p>

Hm. 

The pages are fairly different between a logged-in user and a non-logged-in user.  I had never really noticed how different the homepage was until now, actually, but now I have a bunch of questions for these panels I'm presented with: Your Next Review, Recent Activity, Review of the Day, and Events. 

"Your Next Review" is up and center in a highlighted callout box. I've never written a review before, and I don't plan to. In fact, I'm not even sure where that specific coffeeshop is that it's prompting me to review. 

What is Review of the Day? How is this chosen? Why was it chosen? Also, why was the Review of the day a review from 02/22/2016?  

Why is Recent Activity of people I don't know? Oh okay, so it's a list of things that are "near me".  It simply feels like it's information about people I don't care about, because the main identifier is the user that added it, like my facebook feed. A feed full of people I don't know. 

I'm not much of a contributor of Yelp, so it's apparent that this homepage might not be tailored for people like me. I typically see Yelp as a restaurant/food search engine, and that's it. There's no social network aspect to this for me; that's what facebook/instagram/snapchat is for. 

<span class="image fit">
![I'm going to get so many likes](https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-LH781_NYINST_P_20151117151507.jpg)
</span>

So what is Yelp trying to do with this page then?  I'm not entirely sure. It SEEMS like the primary action is for me to either search for a restaurant, or write a review... and that's it. And I don't want to write a review.  At least, not to post to Yelp for everyone to see. 

Okay okay, let's keep going.  After scrolling down...

Okay now I see "New Businesses in San Francisco" and "Best of Yelp: San Francisco". THIS is the first bit of relevant information to me, personally. I'm going to Yelp with the intent to find a restaurant by some means.  New Restaurants and Best Of lists are much more likely to influence my decision than my non-existent Yelp social network.  Granted, I'm going straight for the search bar anyway, so perhaps it doesn't matter ALL that much.

Annnnd. That's it. Wait why am I logged in. All I want to do is find a restaurant and nothing here helps me do that really. 

Okay. Stream of consciousness over. 

All in all, I'm not sure what Yelp wants me to do after I login. The vast majority of the information on the home page is new data I've never seen before, and, on top of that, I have no idea why I'm seeing it. 

All of this anecodotal evidence brings me to this claim:

**Yelp doesn't encourage users to explore the site for any other reason BUT to use it as a search engine.**

What does this mean?
====================

To me, it means an oversight on user engagement. If the goal is to keep the user engaged, there needs to be a reason why a user would be encouraged to create an account. Once created, the user should be immediately rewarded with all the benefits of being an account holder, and be reminded as such.  And, hopefully, the more engaged the user chooses to be, the more the user gets out of it.

There are phases for a user to be deeply engaged with a product, and the user needs to be provided value all along the way. If the barrier of entry is too high, then that value needs to be worth the effort, or the user won't bother. 

It's important to note first though: *Active users and engaged users are NOT the same thing.*

But Yelp's success WAS its social element
=========================================

Yelp's social aspect of reviews was indeed the reason for its wild success. Earlier review sites of the time attempted to compete by gathering anonymous reviews, but it was Yelp's social branding that allowed Yelp to be the "trustworthy" source of reviews. By forcing users to have a profile, it gave these anonymous reviews a name and a face, forcing each user to present their review as part of their personal branding. A mediocrely written review reflected poorly on the user, not the restaurant. 

Users were excited about this! The idea of building your social capital through your reviews was a good reason for users to hop on board, and the promise of Yelp Elite seealed the deal.  According to a study in 2011, 44% of all reviews on Yelp during the studyâ€™s timeframe were written by elite members. *([source](http://searchengineland.com/yelp-crushed-citysearch-yahoo-why-google-stealing-yelps-playbook-78623))* Some of these particularly engaged users became Community Managers, and they threw exciting Yelp Elite events that really made the high quality reviews untouchable. 

And the psychology behind some of these Yelp Elite Squad members is that [they are doing good](http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/blog/business/2016/03/exclusive-phoenixs-yelp-elite-squad-members-talk.html). There is definitely an element of defending what Yelp stands for and helping out small business. 

And the current layout reflects that mentality. The most important thing for a logged-in user is to quickly *write a review*. And then, beyond that, show some social network things.

So what is causing [all the fuss](http://www.wsj.com/articles/yelp-needs-some-help-1454866219) about user growth now? 

Yelp Elitist
============

I personally think the Yelp reviewer pool is running dry. Google has been building up its listings of restaurants and reviews to moderate success, and people are drawn to whatever is most convenient.  People who have been writing reviews will continue writing reviews, but beyond that, people aren't seeing the reason to join this Yelp community anymore. 

This is based completely off of personal opinion, but I feel the [merit][merit] of a single Yelp review now holds [less respect][respect] than ever before, and Yelp Elite doesn't quite have the same allure as it once did. That [one South Park episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFhDyZ4HFgY) (warning: NSFW South Park language) surely didn't help, either. The challenge to get more people to create quality content must be getting harder, as users are turning to their mobile devices to use the app. 

Accessing the app via mobile makes the social element of Yelp a lot harder, because the social content was never designed to be bite-sized (heh). People don't pull out their phone to simply browse the newest reviews have been written recently (...in my opinion. Maybe some people do). 

The increase in mobile usage is could be a reflection on the convenience of data access, and nothing else. 

If engagement is running low, Yelp needs to address what it means to be engaged with the app in the first place, and recognize that Yelp Elite doesn't mean what it did 5 years ago.  


Engage
======

<div style="width:100%; height:30em; overflow:hidden;">
<span class="image fit">

</span>
</div>

So what does it mean to engage a user? From app to app, it's up to the team to decide and optimize on. 

From [this post on knowtify.io](http://blog.knowtify.io/four-steps-for-creating-a-user-engagement-score/), 

> "What is an engaged customer of [our product]?"  
They should answer with something like, "An engaged user of [our product] does X, Y, Z."

So let's take a look at some potential Engagement Activities for Yelp:

* Search for restaurant/business, read reviews.
* Call business through Yelp. 
* Find directions to business through Yelp. 
* View an event
* Log in
* Save a bookmark
* React to (like, compliment) a review
* Modify restaurant/business information
* Start a "Conversation"
* Share a photo
* Write a review

To be honest, I think Yelp has already done a great job in bringing in traffic from the normal users of the site; the ones that are just there to find the information they want and get out are successfully doing just that. 

So if a user only needs to search for a business, call, and find directions to be considered engaged, then perfect. The lurkers are engaged, *up to the point where they find what they need, and then they leave*.

So what should an engaged user be?  To define that we should first look at what Yelp's ideal user looks like.  Yelp's content is user-generated.  Yelp relies on users to generate new content. It's the community of reviewers that Yelp celebrates, and without engagement from the contributors, Yelp's content atrophies. Perhaps there are studies as to what happens when the community no longer continues to grow; I have no idea what happens. Something tells me, though, as a publically traded company, the market would not look kindly on stagnant growth.

Yelp's goal should be to engage the common user in hopes of converting a user into a reviewer, into an **active contributor to Yelp's ecosystem**, whether that be curating existing Yelp information, sharing a photo, or, ideally, creating new content.  

So how *does* a user go from lurker to a contributing member of Yelp's society?

Contributing to society - Yelp edition
======================================
<span class="image fit">
![community][communitypic]
</span>

Lurkers don't just instantly BECOME power users in a community, especially if the community has been around for some time. There is no magic switch that flips once a user creates an account. Users will create accounts out of curiosity, or if they're forced to. 

A social difficulty curve needs to be addressed when considering how a former lurker evolves into a power user. There should be reasons why a user would want to in the first place.  According to the [1% rule of Internet Culture][internet-culture], 1% of the users of a website actively create new content, 9% modify that content, while 90% lurk. 

Let's break down those Engagement Activities into these user-types. 

| **Activity** | **User type** | **Log in required** | 
|--- | :-: | :-: |
| Search for restaurant/business, read reviews. | Lurker | N |
| Call business through Yelp. | Lurker | N | 
| Find directions to business through Yelp. | Lurker | N |
| View an event | Lurker | N |
| Log in | Curious Lurker |  |
| Save a bookmark | Curious Lurker | Y |
| React to (like, compliment) a review | Modifier | N |
| Modify restaurant information | Modifier | N |
| Start a "Conversation" | Creator | Y |
| Share a photo | Creator | Y |
| Write a review | Creator | Y |

Curiously enough, there are several of these activities that can be done anonymously, which causes users to subconsciously wonder what the point of creating an account is at all, if not to simply give Yelp more data?  What is the value to the *user*?  

The Curious Lurker
==================

According to the 1% rule, 90% are lurkers. These are the users that enjoy using the site for the services that it immediately provides.  In Yelp's case, it's the catalog of restaurants and businesses. They might see the community from the outside, but they might not have stepped their foot in the door quite yet. They simply enjoy the content for what it is, and the lurker's engagement with the product solely lies on how much value the lurker gets out of it (i.e. how easy it is to find what restaurant to eat at).

If the goal is to entice the lurker to step inside and begin interacting with the community, there needs to be a reason for the lurker to want to do so.  There need to be benefits that the lurker can immediately reap while he/she is toying with the idea of being an active member. With new benefits in hand, the user will be more willing to explore the community, and explore all the social aspects.  

This is the [social difficulty curve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuG7mIpVFc0), which is brought up in game design for online multiplayer games.  Guiding the user, encouraging the user to take the next step when the user feels ready, allowing the user to come to a conclusion himself/herself based on all the pleasant experiences before: these are all methodically designed with the user in mind. In fact, many games eventually fail if they are not designed properly. 

Now obviously, the gamification card has been played out over the last few years, so I'm not necessarily talking badges, achievements, and progress bars.  That would be potentially force feeding a trite gamification idea without properly analyzing the situation. But the abstract idea of "progress" can still be applied. 

The path from lurker to Yelp Elite is not a short one for reluctant users. 

In Part 2, I'm going to dive deeper into this idea to see how this path might be improved.
