# Simplifying complexity vs ELI5
If you boil it down to its core, the role of the product manager can be fairly simple. You lay out the game to play, how to keep score, and prioritize the problems. 

As a product manager, I can read that, nod my head in agreement, and think about how all the work I've done over the years falls into one of those buckets. The nuances are generalized and the simple framework applies. The complexity has been simplified. 

That being said, has the concept been communicated to those that _aren't_ already knowledgeable? 

Would a 5 year old be able to read it and understand what it is that Product Manager does? 

# Don't overthink it, just keep it simple
I once had a manager remind me to "simplify complexity" after hemming and hawing over technical nuances and implications of a product choice. 

To be honest, at the time, it completely rubbed me the wrong way. It came off as a naive "don't overthink it too much" kind of response. To me, these technical nuances _mattered_ and could have some major implications down the line. To "simplify" this complexity would completely trivialize the matter, and could create major work down the line. And for technical platforms, this may end up being a tax or technical debt that compounds over time. 

I ended up deciding that the risk of incurred technical debt was low, and I kept it "simple" to continue. I kept on thinking about it though - I knew there was truth, and I wanted to really understand the nuances. After chewing on the statement for longer, I realize there could be more value to be extracted behind its simple command. 

## Simplify to communicate
The process of hemming and hawing is confusing to others -- the act of trying to decide how to set up the platform to acommodate for a world of features that don't exist yet, trying to communicate in abstracts, etc is utterly confusing for anyone who isn't living in your head. 

If you're prone to that type of overthinking (which is a good thing, in my opinion), it's important to understand when and how to keep it simple for _others_. More importantly, if you are already "overthinking," chances are you could have communicated ideas out _earlier_, when it the ideas were already simple, and allow the _team_ to help with the complexity. The complexity is never on one person. 

## Simplify to structure
The "simple" idea is the foundation for structuring the complexity. Understanding which pieces are necessary and which pieces are not may be as simple as asking the question: "Is this what the users are asking for?" 

Finding the buckets to organize people's ideas creates frameworks and structures for everyone to collaborate and visualize thoughts and concerns. The complexities still exist, but they live in the appropriate places. 

## Simplify to unblock
Keeping objectives, user stories, sprint goals, etc. "simple" allows everyone involved to easily prioritize their own complexities as well. "Is this is priority?" turns into a quick "Does this help achieve the sprint goal?" 

# At the end of the day
"Keeping things simple" is _not_ the same as _ignoring_ complexity. What it actually enables is _easier_ collaboration if the simplified points are carefully communicated and structured. 

There is absolutely an art and nuance to finding simple concepts and descriptions to things that are incredibly complex in nature. Like how professionals make incredibly technically difficult things look absolutely effortless, good simple communication keeps the nuance in mind, and finds the core pieces that extract the most meaning to the party that is receiving it (the Pareto principle strikes again). 

Keep it simple. 

Keep it clean.
