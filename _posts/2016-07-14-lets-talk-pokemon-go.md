Pokemon Go is insanely popular right now. Let's talk about why.

<!--more-->

[TechCrunch recently posted](https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/13/pokemon-go-tops-twitters-daily-users-sees-more-engagement-than-facebook/) that Pokemon Go has topped Twitter's Daily Users, and sees more engagement on Facebook, according to reports from various tracking firms.

Ridiculous.

Within a few mere days, it's become the biggest US mobile game EVER, with its usage numbers closing in on Snapchat on Android, and *even Google Maps* on Android.  It's getting people to explore, exercise, and even (gasp) socialize. And [it's been causing some pretty bizarre things to happen](http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/pokemon-go-the-eight-weirdest-incidents-so-far-w212891) too. 

How long can this usage keep up?  Does this game have lasting power?  

As much as I want it to last forever, I'm fairly certain it won't maintain this level of popularity, as all things that go viral eventually fall back to acceptable numbers. 

However, I want to take the opportunity to break down a few design aspects of the game that I think drove its virality, and maybe a few things that will help maintain some sort of popularity.  

I'll assume that you somewhat know how this game works already, so I won't go into too much to explaining the mechanics.

Nostalgia + Hype
================
Let's be honest here. This was a game 20 years in the making. Every PokeTrainer, retired and current, has been waiting for this game to come out ever since they caught their first Pokemon in their GameBoy, or watched Ash Ketchum triumph against all odds through the power of love and friendship.

</span>The amount of hype that had been generated for this game was pretty crazy. As far as I remember, there were maybe... [one video commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sj2iQyBTQs) for it that spread like wildfire before, and that was enough. Notice that the commercial wasn't directed towards kids. It was clearly directed towards the generation that grew up with the game. 

The casual fans now had the game on their radars, and the serious ones would be counting down the days until release. Sidenote: people gave Nintendo a lot of flak for the odd [Pokemon Super Bowl ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F46tGehnfo) that didn't seem to really advertise anything. For those that don't remember, the advert showed sequences of people being inspired to train for something, and near the end a person walking into a Pokemon stadium, and as the Pokemon battle starts, they show it inspiring a kid and his father (and Pikachu!) watching the battle on TV.  The commercial ended with the tagline "TRAIN ON: Celebrating 20 years of Pokemon".  Given the success of Pokemon Go, I'm positive it did exactly what it needed to. By showing the kid and his father both entranced, it immediately reminded 20 and 30-somethings of their youth and how magical Pokemon was at the time. It quickly planted the seed of "Pokemon in the real world" by showing real actors interacting with animated Pokemon. Around that time, I'm sure the last thing people were doing was reminiscing about Pokemon.  

So imagine some months later Pokemon Go is released.  "So you're saying I can walk around and just FIND Pokemon in the real world? AND I can catch them??" 

Instantly sold. 

Nostalgia beats Technical Difficulties
======================================

And when the game finally launched... Server issues galore. <span class="image right">
<img src="http://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Pokemon-Go-Server-Issues-635x384.jpg">
</span>Gym battle glitches, Pokemon capture glitches, map update glitches, check-in glitches.

For ANY other game, this would've caused players to jump ship immediately. The frustration wouldn't be worth the effort to play. But not so for Pokemon. 

This was a game everyone wanted, and during a time when everyone was looking for a reason to escape, they found it in Pokemon Go. The players right now will slog through the server issues, the battery drains, just so they can continue to catch them all.

Low Barrier of Entry
====================
So the game itself has a level of hype that is typically unmatched for mobile games. And the game is... free. It costs zero dollars for players to relive a childhood dream of theirs. That's worth it. 

This game was primed for a viral start, just by sheer numbers. 

Engagement
==========
The game is pretty simple, as mobile games tend to be. The must-know mechanics are easy to grasp; open the app, walk around in the real-world. Catch Pokemon.

On top of the basic sense of level and achievement that many games have, Pokemon touches upon a certain emotion that gives it such a great advantage: a pure sense of unadulterated exploration. And how Pokemon Go achieves that is brilliant. 

A lot of the game relies on slot machine mechanics. Pokemon spawn randomly, in random places, at random times. They spawn just often enough so that players never get too frustrated by the hunt, and they spawn infrequently enough that the players always feel rewarded for their efforts. And even though the Pokemon spawning location and timing is random, the game brilliantly makes the players work for it. If players choose to, they can check to see which Pokemon are nearby, and physically play hot-cold with it until they catch it. Players of any game like to feel rewarded for their efforts, and even though players KNOW that a lot of the game is up to the random number generator, it is that POSSIBILITY that the rare Pokemon appears that will keep players engaged. THIS is challenge that players feel they are being rewarded for. The random elements of the game keep everyone excited because it *gives everyone a chance* to win. 

But this game is much more than simply waiting for the RNG gods to grant players a new Pokemon. There is something absolutely necessary for the random encounter to happen, to even be able to spin the metaphorical slot machine: <span class="image right">

</span>
everything in the game requires physical exploration. Players are required to go outside and walk, bike, *move physical location* to progress in the game.  And this, I feel, changes the psychology of the game altogether. 

Mobile games have long relied on short, addicting, bite-sized sessions that can be played in any moment. If you're stuck in a line, waiting at the bank, a quick level of Candy Crush wouldn't hurt anyone. Sessions for games like these are often severely limited, employing a "hearts" or "lives" or "energy" system.  This is to prevent players from progressing too much too quickly. A single Pokemon Go session, however, can go... for as long as the player is willing to play.  If the player only has time to run to the corner store and back, the player can fire up the app and walk. If the player has a whole afternoon to explore a city, that whole afternoon can be dedicated to Pokemon Go. People are ALLOWED to play for as long as they want. Sessions are limited to how much the player wants to stay outside for, which is an entirely new metric to go off.

And the player is ENGAGED like never before. If the player wants to find Pokemon, the app MUST be active. The game forces the player to PLAY the game actively.  Notifications from any other app are a distcraction to the game.  If players aren't paying attention, they could miss valuable items, or even worse, a super rare Pokemon. 

This is changing the playing field for mobile games.  Pokemon Go is bringing elements of the most popular MMORPGs and smashing them into a mobile game that forces you to interact with the real world.  

Elements of popular MMORPGs rarely translate well to mobile games due to the limits of the world contained in the screen. The entire world of Candy Crush is located in that tiny device in your hand. If you look up, that world is gone. If you turn off the screen, the world shuts down. 

But for Pokemon Go, the real world IS part of the fantasy world. Turning off your phone merely shuts down the portal between the two worlds, but both worlds will continue to exist. This is Augmented Reality (AR), and Pokemon Go is just scratching the surface. 

Seeing another person catch a Pokmeon INSTANTLY elicits emotions of jealousy and FOMO that no other mobile game can generate, because the world of Pokemon is always spinning. And *all you have to do is pull out your phone* to keep playing.  Cries of "THERE'S A SQUIRTLE HERE" become signal beacons to anyone NOT playing at the moment to get sucked back in again. It's an event that happens in a specific time, in a specific place, in a fantasy world that... is actually our world.

Pokemon Social Hour
===================
When you picture a hardcore "gamer", images of a kid sitting in front of a TV or computer still come to mind. And yet, this game has managed to shake that image off (sort of).  Pokemon Go is operating on a completely different level. Businesses are capitalizing on the increased foot traffic, internet memes are popping up everywhere. People are jokingly pledging allegiances to teams and forming instant bonds with strangers all around. I mean, [how cool](https://i.redd.it/js9r4887g19x.gif) [are these](https://i.imgur.com/mmlsxKr.gifv) [fan-made logos](http://imgur.com/0YCN0u0)?

<span class="image left">

</span>Pokemon Go has its players walking around outside, interacting with the city streets around you. Suddenly, those that "have better things to do than sit around and play video games" don't really know what to think. The potential player base is much more than those that loved the game as a kid. If you just loved watching the cartoon, this would be enough to casually step back into the universe. And you wouldn't be alone. Ignoring the fact that players look like zombies glued to their phones walking around, the fact that it's so easy to recognize when someone else is playing gives everyone a sense of validation, a confirmation that, yes, this game is fun, and it's okay to "be caught" in public playing it.  

What's Next for Pokemon Go?
===========================
I don't know what Nintendo and Niantic have planned, but they've carefully spaced out features to release to keep the players interested over a period of time. 

**Increased personalization:**  
Players are currently in a stage where everything is new and on a relative equal playing field. I feel that Niantic/Nintendo have plenty of time before this happens, but as the players mature, natural separations of player types will eventually appear, and the game will soon need to provide enough content for each type if it wants to retain that player.  Hardcore "achievement" type players will continue to grind out their Pokemon, determined to achieve the highest level they can. These Achievers will eventually seek something that will recognize and identify their greatness. (Local gym leaderboards? Community Gym Leaders?) However, as the Achievers continue to grind, the casual players will eventually feel the fatigue of playing the game when they realize there's no point trying to compete with the Achievers with their incredibly high level Pokemon.

I wouldn't be surprised if the developers found a way to introduce new ways to foster closer relationships to a Pokemon that you catch, and ways to ever so slightly customize the appearance. Imagine a mechanic where you can choose a Pokemon to "walk with" and the Pokemon appears on the map following your avatar. As you walk with it, a new "happiness" meter fills for that Pokemon, and when it builds... maybe new Pokemon emote animations are unlocked, or new accessories to decorate that Pokemon's profile screen. Perhaps you can take a selfie with the Pokemon, using the AR element again. I'm just saying, if I could take a selfie with the Squirtle Squad, I'd be a happy man.

Remember Tamagotchis? Or even the [Pikachu Virtual Pet](http://kotaku.com/5872151/the-virtual-pikachu-that-didnt-need-food-just-affection)? THINK OF THE POSSIBILITIES.

Increased personalization will keep Socializer and Explorer player types engaged, as their satisfaction out of the game is not directly linked to how efficiently they are playing the game. With more options to personalize a specific Pokemon, these players will continue to be encouraged to explore the real world in search of a rare Pokemon, and progress in that fashion.

Since developers have already announced that trading will be coming soon, it makes me think that Pokemon personalization elements will fit right in. 

**Pokemon Events:**  
This was already teased before, but I'm certain that sometime in the future, when interest in the game begins to dip, a Pokemon Event will be announced. Chances are, something will happen, and players will be required to go to a specific location (probably a sponsored location. Think of that $$$) to participate in a legendary battle.  Maybe it'll be the first legendary Pokemon sighting. Maybe it will be a global crisis where team members will need to unite against a common enemy. Whatever it is, real-time events will certainly be introduced for people to gather. I wouldn't be surprised if developers are already reaching out to create Community Managers for this game. Given that similar things are already happening organically ([pub crawls](https://www.facebook.com/events/1779733858973460/), ["Mystery Island"](https://www.facebook.com/events/1052153354867631/), it makes sense if it's officially supported by the developers.

Conclusion
==========
Pokemon Go has become a global phenomenon thanks to its great design, nostalgic elements, and AR gameplay. Whether it ends up being a new Pokemon renaissance, or just a flash in the pan... time will tell. But either way, not only has this opened a path for a Pokemon resurgance, it's also paved the way for other fantasy universes to explore AR gametypes (ghost hunting, alien invasion, spy hunting, anyone?).  

The makings of a renaissance are in motion, and I can't wait to see where that takes us.
